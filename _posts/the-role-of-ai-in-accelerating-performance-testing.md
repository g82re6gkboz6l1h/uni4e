## Why Performance Testing Matters in Today's Digital World

Performance testing validates speed, scalability, responsiveness, and resilience of systems under expected workloads. For example, an e-commerce platform witnessing high traffic during a flash sale could face crashes and revenue loss without sufficient performance testing. By simulating such scenarios, developers can proactively address system inefficiencies and safeguard user satisfaction.

Traditional testing methods are often manual, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. With AI, organizations are now leveraging automation and intelligence to address these pain points more effectively.
