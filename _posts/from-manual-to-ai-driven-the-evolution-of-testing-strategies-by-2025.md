## From Manual Testing to Intelligent Automation: A Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **The Dawn of Manual Testing**
Initially, QA teams conducted error-prone, labor-intensive manual tests. While exhaustive, these processes lacked speed and adaptability, proving inefficient in agile development cycles.

### 2. **Automated Testing Revolution**
Automated solutions like Selenium introduced faster and more consistent scripted test executions. Yet, environmental changes still required significant intervention and revisions.

### 3. **AI-Powered Testing of the Future**
By 2025, tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) bridge the gap with real-time, adaptive testing, reducing human intervention and redefining efficiency.
