## Understanding Automation’s Evolution into AI Intelligence

Software testing has long relied on automation tools like Selenium and Appium to manage repetitive, rule-based tasks, boosting efficiency. But these tools fall short of intelligence—operating within the constraints of pre-written scripts. AI changes the game entirely, bringing adaptability, predictive capabilities, and context-aware analysis. Unlike automation, AI tools like Zof AI learn from data, uncover hidden defects, and enable QA teams to focus on innovation rather than routine execution. For companies, this shift marks a pivotal moment in optimizing workflows to match the demands of complex software ecosystems.
