## Introduction: The Impact of AI on Software Testing

Artificial intelligence is redefining traditional software testing methods. Unlike manual testing and rule-based automation, AI leverages machine learning (ML), predictive analytics, and natural language processing (NLP) to minimize human errors, boost test coverage, and optimize workflows. Key breakthroughs such as intelligent defect prediction and self-healing test scripts are enabling QA teams to focus on strategic goals instead of repetitive tasks.

AI tools like Zof AI epitomize this transformation. Zof AI integrates ML to analyze testing data, predict potential failures, and optimize test prioritization. As AI innovations continue, their adoption is becoming the gold standard in software testing practices.
