## Top Challenges in Traditional Quality Assurance

Conventional QA practices face significant hindrances, including:

1. **Human Error**: Manual tasks often result in subjectivity, fatigue, and errors.
2. **Time Intensiveness**: Lengthy inspection processes delay production.
3. **Inconsistent Standards**: Varying processes can create quality discrepancies across products and teams.
4. **High Costs**: QA requirements inflate operational budgets.
5. **Complex Systems**: Handling interconnected systems such as IoT and AI complicates testing processes further.

To overcome these hurdles, industries are embracing AI-powered solutions.
