## Continuous Testing: The Backbone of Agile Development  

### What is Continuous Testing?
Continuous testing is the process of testing applications at every stage of development, from conception to deployment. Unlike traditional testing, which often occurs after the development process, this practice embeds testing within the pipeline, aligning it with Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

### Why AI is Essential for Continuous Testing
Despite its advantages, manual continuous testing presents challenges such as resource demands, human errors, and operational bottlenecks. AI alleviates these issues by automating test procedures, predicting errors, analyzing vast datasets, and optimizing workflows. 
[Zof AI](https://zof.ai) is a leading innovator in the field, showcasing how AI-powered solutions are enhancing automation, analytics, and pipeline integration.
