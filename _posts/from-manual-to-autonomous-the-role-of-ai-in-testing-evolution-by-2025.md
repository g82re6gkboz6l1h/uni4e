## The Evolution: From Manual Testing to AI-Driven Systems

Quality assurance has always been critical for delivering robust software. For decades, manual methods dominated testing, requiring meticulous human effort to design, execute, and analyze test cases. While manual testing ensured accuracy, it came at the cost of time, scalability, and resources.

The rise of test automation tools like Selenium, JUnit, and TestNG brought much-needed efficiency, handling repetitive tasks while improving accuracy. Yet, automation demanded significant manual scripting, updating, and monitoring, limiting its potential in dynamic environments. This gap has now been bridged by AI-driven testing frameworks. 

AI-powered tools leverage machine learning and natural language processing for self-healing test scripts, real-time defect detection, and automated system adaptability. They analyze historical testing data to predict changes and optimize processes more effectively. This evolution represents the future of testing, ensuring products are scalable, error-free, and market-ready faster than ever before.
