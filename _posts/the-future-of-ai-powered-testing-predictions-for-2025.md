## Introduction to AI in Testing

Artificial intelligence has already paved the way for smarter QA practices beyond traditional automation. Conventional test models have limitations such as scalability challenges and manual effort reliance, but AI addresses these issues with technologies like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics.

### Applications of AI in Testing
- **Automated test script generation**: AI automatically writes scripts based on performance patterns.
- **Defect prediction**: Historical data enables AI to identify high-risk areas before defects occur.
- **Self-healing scripts**: Adjustments to test scripts happen dynamically in response to real-time changes.
- **Test coverage optimization**: AI fills crucial gaps by identifying untested areas for maximum efficiency.

AI’s adaptability and precision are indispensable for QA teams navigating today’s complex software development needs.
