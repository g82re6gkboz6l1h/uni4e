## Overcoming Traditional QA Challenges

The limitations of conventional QA processes are becoming increasingly evident in high-speed development cycles:

### 1. Time-Intensive Methods:
Manual testing consumes extensive resources and slows down project timelines with tasks like scalability testing, regression reviews, and debugging.

### 2. Limited Test Coverage:
Traditional methods struggle to replicate real-world conditions or test across a wide range of devices, browsers, and environments, leading to missed bugs.

### 3. Human Error:
Manual testing is prone to mistakes, increasing the risk of undetected defects.

### 4. Cost Inefficiencies:
Manual QA demands large teams and high budgets, making scalability a challenge for start-ups and enterprises alike.

These issues demand an AI-powered transformation powered by Zof AI.
