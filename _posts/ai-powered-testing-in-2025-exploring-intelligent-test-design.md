## What is Intelligent Test Design?

Intelligent test design harnesses AI algorithms to dynamically create, execute, and adapt test cases based on real-world data, user behavior, and evolving product needs. This flexible approach surpasses traditional static methods by utilizing machine learning (ML) to simulate scenarios, predict risks, and identify bugs.

### Key Features of Intelligent Test Design:

- **Context-Awareness**: AI interprets vast datasets to make testing more accurate.
- **Self-Learning Algorithms**: Test systems improve with every execution.
- **Continuous Feedback**: Real-time adaptation ensures relevance in dynamic environments.

By 2025, intelligent test design has become essential for software teams to remain competitive.
