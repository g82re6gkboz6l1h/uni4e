## Common QA Challenges and Why AI Tools Are the Answer

### Problems with Traditional QA Testing:

1. **Time-Consuming:** Manual testing is slow, pulling timelines and delaying product releases due to repetitive tasks.
2. **Error-Prone:** Human errors during testing lead to reduced product efficiency and missed bugs.
3. **Limited Test Coverage:** Time constraints make it challenging to achieve full software test coverage.
4. **Scalability Issues:** Expanding QA for complex apps requires more staff, which increases costs.
5. **Data Constraints:** Manually working with large datasets is impractical, limiting testing effectiveness.

AI solutions have emerged to address these limitations, delivering precision, speed, and scalability in QA processes.
