## The Essence of Continuous Testing
Continuous testing extends beyond a single phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It automates testing at every touchpoint across development, deployment, and production, ensuring bugs are caught early. From manual QA efforts to the latest developments in automation, testing has transformed significantly.

AI now takes these advancements further with self-healing scripts, improved anomaly detection, and risk-based test prioritization. As frameworks scale for complex software systems, adopting AI-infused solutions becomes essential for sustained software delivery excellence.

Why AI Dominates Continuous Testing
### Benefits of AI:
1. **Smarter Automation**: Intelligent test prioritization reduces wasted resources.
2. **Self-Healing Properties**: Scripts intuitively adapt to code changes, saving hours of maintenance.
3. **Enhanced Insights with Analytics**: Predictive capabilities focus on hotspots to minimize risks.
