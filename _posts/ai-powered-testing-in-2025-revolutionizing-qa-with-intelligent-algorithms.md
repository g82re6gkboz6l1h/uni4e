## The Past, Present, and Future of AI in Software Testing

Software testing is vital to ensuring robust applications that deliver unparalleled user experiences. From manual testing's laborious beginnings to today’s AI-driven advancements, the evolution of testing has been nothing short of extraordinary.

### Historical Overview of AI in Testing:
1. **Manual Testing Era**: Time-intensive processes prone to errors and scalability challenges.
2. **Automation in the 2010s**: Tools like Selenium and Appium introduced efficiency but demanded script maintenance and lacked true adaptability.
3. **AI Steps In**: By the 2020s, ML algorithms predicted bugs, NLP-powered tools generated tests, and exploratory testing simulations brought human-like insights to the table.

By 2025, AI promises a quantum leap forward, moving QA from reactive to genuinely predictive and proactive practices.
