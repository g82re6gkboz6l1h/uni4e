## Challenges in Manual and Script-Based Testing
Manual and script-based testing, though foundational for quality assurance, face significant drawbacks in modern software development:

- **Time-Consuming**: Writing test cases and executing manual tests demand excessive resources, especially with growing software complexity.
- **High Error Rates**: Manual processes often overlook defects, leading to inconsistent execution and inadequate test coverage.
- **Maintenance-Heavy**: Script-based test cases require constant updates, delaying deployments and increasing inefficiencies.
- **Lack of Real-Time Feedback**: Traditional testing fails to provide swift insights, delaying defect resolutions.
- **Weak in Testing Edge Cases**: These methods struggle with spotting edge-case bugs, impacting overall system integrity.

The growing need for seamless, efficient, and scalable testing demands AI-driven solutions.
