## What Is Predictive QA Testing?

Predictive QA testing leverages advanced algorithms, machine learning, and data analysis to predict defects, bottlenecks, and risks early in the development lifecycle. Unlike reactive traditional QA, predictive testing is proactive, offering real-time insights to optimize software quality before deployment.

Key technologies like machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) analyze historical data and testing patterns, delivering:
- Faster feedback cycles
- Reduced testing redundancy
- Cost-effective quality solutions
