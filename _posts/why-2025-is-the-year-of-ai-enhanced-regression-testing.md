## 1. Challenges in Traditional Regression Testing

### **What is Regression Testing?**
Regression testing verifies that software updates, such as bug fixes or feature additions, safeguard previous functionality. However, traditional approaches face mounting challenges:

- **High Costs & Time Demands**: Thousands of test cases in complex software escalate time and expenses, slowing delivery.
- **Flaky Tests**: Fragile test cases yield inconsistent results, wasting resources.
- **Complicated Maintenance**: Keeping test suites updated amidst constant technological change is draining.
- **Debugging Bottlenecks**: Identifying specific failures amidst large test datasets delays fixes.

With these limitations, organizations need **AI-driven solutions** for smarter and faster regression testing.
