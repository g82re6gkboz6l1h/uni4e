## Why Test Coverage and Accuracy Are Critical in Quality Assurance

In QA, **test coverage** describes the extent to which system functionalities are examined, ensuring comprehensive testing across use cases, integrations, and edge cases. Meanwhile, **test accuracy** focuses on reliable predictions of software behavior in the real world.

Failing to secure adequate test coverage and accuracy can have severe consequences:

1. **Costly Failures and Downtime:** Untested software edge cases can result in crashes and reduced performance.
2. **Customer Attrition:** Poor user experiences due to bugs and glitches damage customer trust.
3. **Financial Losses:** Debugging neglected scenarios post-launch can drastically increase operational costs.
4. **Development Bottlenecks:** Limited QA resources lead to repetitive testing cycles that increase time-to-market.

Rapid advancements in software complexity, such as multi-platform integrations and growing cloud ecosystems, demand next-level solutions. AI is the answer—offering scalable and intelligent enhancements to bolster QA processes seamlessly.
