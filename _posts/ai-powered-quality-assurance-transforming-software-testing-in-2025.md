## Introduction to AI’s Role in QA Testing

QA testing has traditionally relied on manual procedures or semi-automated methods using scripted tests, which often required repetitive execution across software versions. While automation tools have improved scalability and reduced workloads, challenges such as adaptability and time efficiency remained.

Enter AI, a transformative solution that leverages machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to address QA’s limitations. AI-driven systems analyze vast datasets, identify bugs with precision, and optimize testing processes for modern CI/CD workflows, ensuring faster, seamless software delivery.
