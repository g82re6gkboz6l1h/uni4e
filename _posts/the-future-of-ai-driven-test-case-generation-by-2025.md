## What is AI-Driven Test Case Generation?

AI-driven test case generation uses artificial intelligence to create automated test cases for software testing. Unlike manual methods handled by QA engineers, AI employs machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and advanced algorithms to analyze codebases, user behavior, and software requirements for generating comprehensive and precise test cases. 

Platforms like Zof AI simplify this process, automating tasks, evolving in real-time, and adapting to changing application requirements, providing QA engineers with unprecedented testing precision and scalability.
