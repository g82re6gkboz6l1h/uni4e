## The Decline of Manual Testing in Favor of AI-Powered Automation

Historically, manual testing has served as the cornerstone of software QA. Yet, as modern applications become more advanced, manual methods struggle to meet the speed, scalability, and precision demands of today's workflows. AI automation, however, excels in these areas, automating repetitive tasks, executing tests in bulk, and analyzing results with unparalleled accuracy.

Today’s fastest-paced organizations rely on AI systems to optimize testing, support Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) processes, and maintain the velocity needed for daily or even hourly software updates. As manual testing becomes increasingly inadequate for such demands, businesses are adopting AI to stay competitive and improve software quality.
