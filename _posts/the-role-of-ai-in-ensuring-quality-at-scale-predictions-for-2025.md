## Why Scalability Requires AI in QA
### Challenges in Traditional QA Processes
- **Ecosystem Complexity**: Ensuring compatibility across diverse devices and setups is nearly impossible manually.
- **Budget Limitations**: Scaling traditional QA methods often fails due to costly human involvement.
- **Agile Deadlines**: Short sprint cycles leave little time for extensive manual testing.

### How AI Transforms QA at Scale
AI adds value by:
- **Automating Test Processes**: Creating and executing tests autonomously to improve coverage.
- **Continuous Testing Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrating into CI/CD pipelines for agile projects.
- **Predictive Risk Analysis**: Prioritizing high-risk areas for improved insights.
- **Scaling with Efficiency**: Multitasking across platforms to save time with enhanced consistency.
