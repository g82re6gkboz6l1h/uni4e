## The Rise of AI in QA Testing

Manual QA has been the backbone of software testing, but it can't match the speed and accuracy needed in today's agile and DevOps environments. AI improves efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, generating intelligent test cases, detecting patterns, prioritizing issues, and scaling for complex systems. **Key benefits include:**

- Faster and more accurate testing cycles.
- Automated UI/UX visual scanning.
- Predictive analytics to prevent bugs.
