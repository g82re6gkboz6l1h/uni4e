## Why Continuous Testing Needs AI

Modern software development demands seamless integration of testing processes, but traditional approaches are reaching their limits. The sheer volume, complexity, and speed of today’s Agile and DevOps workflows expose three key challenges:

- **Complex Systems**: Applications are now interconnected with APIs, databases, and third-party services, requiring smarter test architectures.
- **Time Sensitivity**: Traditional testing often creates bottlenecks, delaying deployment cycles.
- **Human Error**: Manual testing is prone to inaccuracies, especially under time pressure.

AI-powered tools tackle these challenges head-on, enabling machine learning algorithms, intelligent analytics, and predictive modeling to streamline testing efforts and enhance accuracy.
