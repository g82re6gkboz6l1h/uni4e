## How AI is Changing Software Testing

Traditionally, software testing has relied on manual processes or basic automation tools, both requiring extensive human intervention. AI introduced intelligent automation, bridging gaps by mimicking human decision-making and handling tasks with speed and precision. Its evolution includes generating self-maintaining scripts, autonomously executing regression testing, and predicting failures before they impact system performance.

Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) simplify and optimize end-to-end QA processes by leveraging machine learning to identify defects, enhance system reliability, and reduce human error. By mastering historical testing data, AI in QA is becoming increasingly proactive and adaptive, prepared to shape a future of seamless software development by 2025.
