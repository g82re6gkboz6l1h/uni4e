## Common Challenges in Traditional Software Testing

### 1. **Time-Intensive Tasks**
Manual testing for large-scale applications takes extensive hours or even days. Though automated testing reduces duration, its setup and maintenance demands significant resources.

### 2. **Inadequate Test Coverage**
With applications growing more intricate, full test coverage across platforms often remains unachievable under traditional methodologies.

### 3. **Human-Induced Errors**
Frequent mistakes by manual testers hinder accurate results, especially in repetitive tasks such as regression testing.

### 4. **Inflexible Adaptations**
Dynamic workflows in Agile development struggle under traditional testing, unable to meet iterative changes promptly.

### 5. **Costly Operations**
The cumulative time and resources involved in conventional testing result in escalating expenses.
