## AI-Powered Changes in QA Testing

Manual testing and traditional automated tests can be time-consuming and fallible. AI introduces smarter workflows:
- **Machine Learning**: Creates predictive models to identify potential failures.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enhances test automation by creating executable test cases directly from user stories.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Shifts testing toward risk prevention rather than mitigation.
Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) leverage these advancements, learning from data to enhance testing efficiency.
