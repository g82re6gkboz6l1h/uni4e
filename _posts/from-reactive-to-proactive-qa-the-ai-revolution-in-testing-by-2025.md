## Reactive vs. Proactive QA Explained

Reactive QA focuses on addressing bugs and issues after they appear, relying on manual testing and static use cases. Proactive QA, however, leverages AI-driven predictive analytics to anticipate vulnerabilities during the development process, ensuring agile processes, minimized risks, quicker releases, and enhanced software quality.
