## What is Predictive Analytics in Software Testing?
Predictive analytics applies machine learning, data insights, and statistical models to predict future software issues. Leveraging historical test data, user feedback, error logs, and code analysis, QA teams can proactively address issues before deployment.

With AI, predictive analytics identifies high-risk areas, improves accuracy, and optimizes resource utilization. Imagine detecting bottlenecks during the design phase or predicting coding flaws mid-development—this is the modern software testing paradigm we’re heading toward by 2025.
