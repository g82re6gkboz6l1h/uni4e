## Introduction to Predictive Problem Solving Using AI

Predictive problem solving identifies and mitigates software vulnerabilities proactively rather than reactively. AI-powered testing employs machine learning (ML) to analyze substantial amounts of historical data, forecasting system failures, user errors, and performance bottlenecks. 

Unlike traditional QA methods, predictive AI ensures reduced downtime, enhanced user experiences, optimized processes, and minimized debugging expenses. By 2025, AI testing will become indispensable for organizations aiming to build efficient, bug-free systems.
