## How AI Enhances Automated Testing

Automated testing uses software tools to execute pre-scripted tests, removing manual intervention from repetitive tasks. While traditional methods are effective for static scenarios, they often miss dynamic use cases or uncover subtle bugs. AI introduces an intelligent layer to complement these limitations. Key benefits include:

- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: AI analyzes hidden workflows, corner cases, and integration points, ensuring comprehensive testing.
- **Self-Healing Capabilities**: AI scripts dynamically adapt to application changes, reducing maintenance.
- **Accelerated Testing Cycles**: AI minimizes script creation and maintenance, enabling faster iteration.
- **Improved Defect Detection**: AI identifies anomalies not visible through traditional methods.

AI-powered testing tools like **Zof AI** reshape the QA landscape, optimizing accuracy, scalability, and reliability.
