## 1. Challenges Facing Traditional Test Automation

Though a cornerstone of modern QA, test automation still grapples with systemic challenges that impede development speed and precision.

### **1.1 Test Maintenance Overload**
Test scripts, often fragile, need frequent updates with application or UI changes, leading to significant overhead and higher costs.

### **1.2 Flaky Test Cases**
Unstable tests that intermittently pass or fail disrupt QA reliability, complicating defect identification.

### **1.3 Incomplete Test Coverage**
Traditional frameworks struggle to address complex applications, especially usability and exploratory testing, leaving critical gaps.

### **1.4 Time-Consuming Debugging**
QA engineers spend extensive time analyzing logs and traces to resolve test failures, hindering deployment timelines.
