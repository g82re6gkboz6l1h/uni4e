## Introduction: AI’s Impact on QA Testing Today

AI is making waves in the QA domain through automation, enabling rapid execution of thousands of test cases and the identification of defects in record time. These improvements reduce manual labor, enhance precision, and save valuable time.

Despite these advantages, many QA teams have yet to fully embrace AI due to hesitations about replacing tried-and-true traditional methods. While automated tools excel in repetitive tasks such as regression and performance testing, creative and complex scenarios still require human judgment. Regardless, AI’s evolution makes it clear that its role in QA will only expand.

Today, predictive analytics, automated workflows, and intelligent reporting are beginning to revolutionize testing. But what does the future hold for software QA by 2025?
