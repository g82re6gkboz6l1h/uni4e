## How AI is Transforming Test Automation

Traditional test automation depends on static rules prone to breakdowns when facing complex, dynamic systems. AI brings intelligence and flexibility to quality assurance (QA). Leveraging machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), AI autonomously adapts tests, predicts outcomes, and identifies patterns. Key benefits include smarter, faster testing adaptable to rapid application updates in agile environments. Tools like Zof AI exemplify how modern AI solutions elevate testing.
