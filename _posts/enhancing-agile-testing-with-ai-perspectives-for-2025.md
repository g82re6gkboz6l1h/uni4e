## Key Agile Testing Principles Enhanced by AI
Agile testing principles include continuous integration, collaboration, flexibility, and frequent delivery of working software. However, manual testing, delayed feedback, and scaling challenges hinder traditional methods. AI eliminates limitations with technologies like predictive analytics, machine learning, and natural language processing.

AI tools autonomously prioritize tests, detect bugs intelligently, and provide near-instant reporting. Embedded AI improves subtle flaw detection, forecasts vulnerabilities, and automates repetitive tasks, ensuring enhanced productivity while delivering quality software quicker.
