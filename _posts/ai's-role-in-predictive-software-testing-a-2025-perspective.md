## Understanding Predictive Testing: Proactive Software Quality Assurance

### What is Predictive Testing?
Predictive software testing uses historical data, code analysis, user behavior, and environmental insights to forecast software bugs, failures, and performance bottlenecks before they fully occur. Unlike traditional reactive testing, predictive testing focuses on preemptive solutions.

### Importance of Predictive Testing
Predictive testing is essential for industries reliant on real-time systems like finance, healthcare, and telecommunications. By forecasting vulnerabilities and addressing them proactively, it minimizes risks, reduces cost, ensures smoother deployments, and mitigates catastrophic outages.
