## Introduction to AI in Software Testing

Quality Assurance (QA) has been a cornerstone of software development success, involving rigorous testing workflows designed to identify defects and ensure software reliability, usability, and performance. Historically, this process depended heavily on manual efforts and static automated testing tools.

AI redefines the QA landscape by leveraging machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics. AI-driven testing tools offer smarter, faster, and more adaptive workflows by analyzing large datasets, detecting anomalies, and predicting defects before they occur. 

Agile development environments demand more than automation—they require intelligence in automation. AI transforms QA into a proactive, strategic process. This article explores the future trajectory of AI in QA and how teams can leverage it in 2025.
