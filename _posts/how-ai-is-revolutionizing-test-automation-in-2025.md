## The Shift to Smarter Test Automation

Test automation has been essential but often challenging for quality assurance teams. Traditional tools like Selenium, while effective, require manual script creation, which is time-intensive and error-prone. AI is disrupting this model by introducing features like self-healing scripts, predictive analytics, and dynamic test generation.

Platforms like Zof AI are spearheading this revolution, offering intelligent frameworks, natural language-based test automation, and advanced defect detection. Learn how these capabilities are empowering enterprises to deliver high-quality software faster, more reliably, and at scale.
