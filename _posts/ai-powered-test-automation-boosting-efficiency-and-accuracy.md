## What is AI-Powered Test Automation?

AI-powered test automation employs Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) to enhance and automate software testing. Unlike traditional automation that relies on static, predefined scripts, AI tools analyze data, adapt to application changes, and mimic human decision-making to identify issues and predict failures. 

Key features include:

- **Intelligent Test Generation**: AI drafts optimized test scripts based on user interaction and application behavior.
- **Self-Healing Scripts**: AI dynamically adjusts scripts to accommodate interface changes without manual edits.
- **Enhanced Defect Prediction**: ML models prioritize risk-based testing.
- **Test Prioritization**: AI identifies and ranks scenarios, allocating resources effectively.

This smart approach revolutionizes software testing by delivering higher accuracy, efficiency, and reduced manual intervention.
