## The Evolution of AI in Software Testing

Manual testing once dominated QA, requiring extensive effort in script creation and debugging. The rise of test automation tools such as Selenium and JUnit reduced inefficiencies but still demanded human management for updates and maintenance. AI revolutionizes testing by introducing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics, enabling:

- **Smarter test script generation**: AI analyzes application behavior and suggests optimized tests.
- **Faster anomaly detection**: AI algorithms identify subtle bugs earlier.
- **Automated test maintenance**: Self-healing capabilities adjust scripts dynamically during updates.

AI-driven tools empower teams to move beyond basic automation to predictive and proactive testing workflows. Platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are driving this transformation.
