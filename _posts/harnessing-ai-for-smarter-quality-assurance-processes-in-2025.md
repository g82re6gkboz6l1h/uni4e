## How AI Enhances QA Processes

AI technology reshapes QA by automating repetitive tasks, identifying bugs quicker, triaging errors, and improving **test accuracy**. Manual QA processes often struggle with repetitive test cases prone to human error, while AI speeds up testing workflows dramatically. **Machine Learning (ML)**, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from test data, optimizing their accuracy over time.

### Key Benefits of AI in QA:
- **Automated Testing**: Handles vast numbers of test cases efficiently.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Analyzes defect patterns for intelligent insights.
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: Reduces manual resources and improves turnaround time.

As we approach 2025, AI will push QA processes to unprecedented levels, ensuring highly adaptive, reliable software testing workflows.
