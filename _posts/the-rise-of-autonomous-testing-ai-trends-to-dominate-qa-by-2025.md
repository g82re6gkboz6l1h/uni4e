## What is Autonomous Testing? How AI is Transforming QA

Autonomous testing leverages AI to independently design, execute, and analyze tests, eliminating constant human intervention. Unlike traditional manual testing, AI-driven tools can dynamically adapt, optimize code coverage, and identify defects more quickly. Major benefits include:
- Faster test execution: Tasks completed in hours instead of days.
- Scalability across complex, multi-platform systems.
- Reduced dependency on human testers for repetitive tasks.

## Technologies Powering Autonomous Testing

### **1. Machine Learning (ML)**
ML drives intelligent test execution by learning from historical data, identifying patterns, and predicting where issues are likely to occur.

### **2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
NLP enables systems to transform written requirements into test cases, fostering inclusion for non-technical teams while speeding up processes.

### **3. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**
RPA replicates user actions for compatibility and UI validation across platforms, delivering precision in repetitive tasks.
