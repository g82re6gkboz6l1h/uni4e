## Why Traditional QA Falls Short in Today’s Tech Landscape

### 1. **Scalability Issues**
Modern applications with millions of users necessitate thousands of test cases across multiple platforms. Traditional QA approaches lack this scalability.

### 2. **Outdated Testing Methodology**
Static scripts dominate older QA frameworks, often breaking with minor software updates, requiring constant maintenance.

### 3. **Prone to Errors**
Human testing is limited by cognitive capacity, which makes it susceptible to missing subtle bugs and edge-case scenarios.

### 4. **High Operational Costs**
Conventional QA is resource-intensive in terms of manpower, training, and infrastructure.
