## The Evolution of Bug Detection in Software Testing

Bug detection has undergone a significant transformation:

1. **Manual Testing Era**: Laborious and error-prone manual code inspection.
2. **Automated Testing**: Tools like Selenium and JUnit introduced streamlined capabilities.
3. **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis**: Techniques to flag vulnerabilities early in the development process.

Despite these advancements, traditional testing methods struggle with the complexity of today’s interconnected systems. This is where AI-powered technologies offer a game-changing solution: transitioning from reactive detection to predictive identification of software vulnerabilities before they escalate.
