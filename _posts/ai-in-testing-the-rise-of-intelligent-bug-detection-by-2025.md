## Challenges of Traditional Bug Detection Methods

### 1. Time-Intensive Processes
Manual and semi-automated testing require significant time and effort, slowing down development timelines.

### 2. Human Error
Manual testing is susceptible to oversight and inconsistencies, often missing critical bugs.

### 3. Limited Scalability
Traditional methods struggle to scale with increasingly complex modern systems like microservices and cloud-based apps.

### 4. Reactive, Not Proactive
Detecting bugs post-deployment elevates costs, risks, and customer dissatisfaction. Traditional approaches often fail to preempt issues.
