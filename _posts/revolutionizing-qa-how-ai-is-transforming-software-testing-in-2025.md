## The State of Software Testing in 2025

Traditional QA methods are quickly becoming obsolete in the face of agile development cycles, continuous integration (CI), and evolving technologies such as IoT and edge computing. The sheer volume of test cases and the pace of modern development cycles are overwhelming for manual or even traditional automated testing approaches. 

AI addresses these challenges by enabling:

- Automatic identification and prioritization of test cases.
- Real-time analytics to detect potential coding issues.
- Increased test coverage compared to manual methods.

By leveraging automation through AI, companies can streamline QA processes, gain speed, and maintain quality, propelling them ahead in today’s competitive landscape.
