## Breaking Down Scalability Challenges in QA

Modern QA demands rapid adaptation to fast-paced development cycles and heightened complexity. Key hurdles include:

### 1. **Increasing App Complexity**
Applications now rely on multi-layered systems, APIs, and third-party connections, which traditional QA tools struggle to handle.

### 2. **Tight Deadlines**
In agile and continuous delivery workflows, limited testing time often results in missed defects and incomplete coverage.

### 3. **Limited Resources**
Expanding QA resources is costly. Many teams face overwhelming workloads and struggle to scale efficiently.

### 4. **Human Error**
Manual testing introduces fatigue and oversights, leaving critical bugs undetected.

These persistent challenges highlight the need for smarter, scalable solutions. This is where Zof AI steps up, revolutionizing QA processes.
