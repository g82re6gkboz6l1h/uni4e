## Understanding Intelligent Automation in Testing

Manual software testing struggles to keep pace with agile and DevOps methodologies. Traditional testing methods are time-consuming and cannot dynamically adapt to evolving application behaviors. This is where intelligent automation steps in.

Intelligent automation blends conventional testing techniques with AI and machine learning, enabling the technology to adapt to application changes, detect defects, and optimize test cases proactively. Unlike traditional scripts, intelligent solutions simulate human cognitive processes to analyze, learn, and refine automatically. This innovation not only reduces manual intervention but also boosts efficiency and accuracy.
