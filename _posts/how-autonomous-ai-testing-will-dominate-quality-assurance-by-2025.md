## What is Autonomous AI Testing?

Autonomous AI testing leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to execute, review, and optimize software testing without human intervention. Unlike traditional testing methods, which rely heavily on manual scripting or semi-automation, AI-powered tools autonomously analyze applications, generate test cases, execute them, and even resolve issues.

Key features of AI testing include:

- **Cognitive Understanding**: Identifying critical application functions by analyzing user flows.
- **Self-Healing Scripts**: Adapting to application updates and changes while maintaining test continuity.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Pinpointing performance bottlenecks and potential defects proactively.
- **Intelligent Decision-Making**: Leveraging historic data patterns to determine optimized testing workflows.

These systems are reshaping QA by increasing speed, precision, and scalability, ensuring software is released bug-free and on time.
