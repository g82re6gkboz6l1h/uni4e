## The Role of Regression Testing in Agile Development

Regression testing ensures new code doesn’t disrupt existing functionality. It validates system stability post-updates, detecting bugs introduced by code modifications or integrations.

### What Makes Regression Testing Pivotal in Agile?

- **Validation Across Updates:** Prevents new code from disrupting existing features.
- **Code Stability:** Maintains software performance during frequent changes.
- **Bug Detection:** Identifies hidden defects caused by integration complexities.

With Agile's fast-paced sprints, traditional regression testing struggles to keep up due to its time-consuming and resource-heavy processes.

## Challenges in Traditional Regression Testing

### 1. **Slow, Manual Processes**
Manual testing cannot match Agile’s speed, often creating bottlenecks.

### 2. **High Costs**
Manual labor and computational resources inflate costs significantly.

### 3. **Complex Scaling**
As systems grow, regression testing struggles to cover intricate functionality without increasing effort.

### 4. **Limited Fault Detection**
Traditional methods miss many corner-case bugs due to human error.

These limitations make AI-powered solutions such as Zof AI essential for modern testing frameworks.
