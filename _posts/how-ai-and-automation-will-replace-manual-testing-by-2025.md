## Understanding the Shortcomings of Manual Testing

While manual testing has been essential for ensuring software quality, its limitations are becoming increasingly problematic in the fast-paced tech world. Here are the key drawbacks:

1. **Time-Intensive**: Repeated execution of test cases becomes tedious, especially for large and complex projects.
2. **Prone to Errors**: Even skilled testers can overlook critical scenarios or make documentation mistakes.
3. **Limited Scalability**: Manual testing struggles to keep pace with rapid development cycles and frequent updates.
4. **High Costs**: Manual testing requires a full QA team, consuming substantial resources.
5. **Restricted Test Coverage**: It's impossible to manually test every interaction in complex systems, leaving gaps in quality checks.

These inefficiencies have pushed organizations to adopt AI-driven solutions and automation to enhance testing effectiveness.
