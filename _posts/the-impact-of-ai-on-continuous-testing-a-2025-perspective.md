## What Is Continuous Testing and Why AI Matters

Continuous testing automates quality feedback across the development lifecycle to ensure superior performance and functionality. This method produces quicker identification of issues and fosters high-quality software releases. However, traditional testing frameworks, which rely on manual configurations and maintenance, often fall short in the fast-paced DevOps era.

AI now addresses these limitations by introducing scalability and intelligence into testing workflows. Modern tools automate previously manual operations, shorten iteration cycles, and enhance testing precision, essential for keeping pace with dynamic development environments.
