## **AI-Driven Testing: A Primer**

AI testing uses machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to optimize the QA lifecycle. Unlike traditional testing methods, AI-driven testing adapts to the dynamic nature of modern software systems, mapping real-world user behaviors to detect faults before they occur.

Key Highlights:
- Faster detection of bugs.
- Predictive capabilities to anticipate system failures.
- Enhanced scalability and cost-effectiveness.
