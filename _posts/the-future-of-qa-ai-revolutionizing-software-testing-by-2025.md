## Introduction to AI in QA and Software Testing

Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are reshaping QA in ways that were previously unimaginable. Traditional testing methods have often been slow and inconsistent with the fast-paced demands of the agile methodology. AI provides QA teams with tools for faster data analysis, smarter test execution, and predictive capabilities to prevent issues before they occur.

By 2025, AI will redefine QA’s role with smarter, data-driven testing strategies that emphasize predictive and adaptive tools over static and inefficacious processes.
