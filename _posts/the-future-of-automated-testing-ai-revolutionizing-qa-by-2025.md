## Why AI in QA Matters More Than Ever

Modern applications demand flawless user experiences, but traditional QA methods—heavy on manual effort and prone to human error—just can’t keep up. AI steps in as the perfect solution. Unlike conventional automation tools limited to predefined scripts, AI uses machine learning models and predictive analytics to adapt, learn, and autonomously identify vulnerabilities. The result? Faster development cycles, superior software quality, and significant cost savings.
