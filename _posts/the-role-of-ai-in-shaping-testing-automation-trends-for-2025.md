## AI in Testing: Innovations Since 2023

In the last few years, AI has redefined traditional QA practices. Pre-2023 automation heavily relied on static, rule-based testing tools that required significant human intervention for updates. By contrast, AI-driven systems now autonomously adapt to complex software ecosystems, minimizing errors and optimizing continuous deployment cycles. Key AI breakthroughs such as deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics have allowed businesses to accelerate feature launches and maintain superior software quality.
