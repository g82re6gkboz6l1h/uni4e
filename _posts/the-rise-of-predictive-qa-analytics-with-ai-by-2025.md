## Predictive Analytics Evolution in Software Testing

Predictive testing in software QA has marked a significant departure from outdated reactive testing practices. Historically, QA teams relied on reactive approaches, where issues were identified and resolved only after they occurred. However, predictive analytics now empowers teams to proactively identify vulnerabilities and optimize workflows. 

Past implementations, using basic statistical models, often came with limitations. Over time, advancements in **machine learning (ML)** enabled complex data modeling and real-time testing insights, revolutionizing QA practices. By 2025, predictive analytics will dominate as QA teams integrate real-time feedback systems into the DevOps pipeline to improve test efficiency while reducing risks.
