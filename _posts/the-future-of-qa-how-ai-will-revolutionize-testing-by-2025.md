## Introduction: The Rise of AI in QA and Software Testing

AI is no longer just a futuristic concept; it’s rapidly penetrating every industry, including QA. Although automation testing reduced manual efforts in the past, it still relies too heavily on rigid scripts. AI flips the script by using machine learning to adapt, analyze, and improve over time. By 2025, predictions indicate widespread adoption of AI-powered QA methods, allowing teams to deliver high-quality software while meeting accelerated timelines.
