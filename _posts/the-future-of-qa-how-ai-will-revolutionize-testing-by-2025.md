## Introduction to AI-driven Testing

AI-driven testing utilizes machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics to automate traditional manual testing processes. Unlike conventional testing, AI learns from data, adapts to changes, and predicts issues before they arise. From regression testing to exploratory and usability testing, AI-powered tools provide faster, more accurate results by reducing human intervention and enhancing precision, essential for continuous testing in DevOps pipelines.
