## Manual vs. AI-Powered Testing: Key Differences

Manual QA, a traditional approach to software testing, has relied on human input to execute test cases and identify flaws. While effective for nuanced scenarios, it is time-intensive and prone to human error. AI-powered platforms leverage machine learning and intelligent automation to deliver faster, scalable, and efficient results. 

By 2025, AI testing dominates due to its ability to handle complex workflows, predictive insights, and continuous optimization. While manual testing remains applicable for usability edge cases, the AI-first approach leads the charge in transforming QA methodologies.
