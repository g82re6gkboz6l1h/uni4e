## Introduction to AI in Software Testing

AI's practical applications reach far beyond theory and have already transformed industries worldwide. In software testing, its potential lies in enhanced automation, intelligent bug detection, and predictive analytics. Unlike traditional methods, AI mimics human intelligence to analyze patterns, detect issues, and autonomously generate test cases.

The key advantage of AI is its ability to self-learn. As systems grow more complex, AI algorithms adapt to deliver improved testing accuracy. This adaptability is crucial in an era where continuous updates and scalability are essential.
