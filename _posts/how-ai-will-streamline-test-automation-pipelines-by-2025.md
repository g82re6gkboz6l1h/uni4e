## Automation Pipelines: A Growing Challenge

Test automation pipelines are now critical to modern software development processes, which often rely on continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) frameworks. However, this progress has introduced several challenges:

1. **Rising Test Volume**: Expanding systems lead to exponentially increasing test cases, requiring smarter execution processes.
2. **Diverse Testing Needs**: Platforms like web, mobile, and IoT demand versatile testing approaches.
3. **Frequent Updates**: Agile and DevOps practices accelerate development cycles, rendering manual strategies obsolete.
4. **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly combining tools for requirements, testing, monitoring, and deployment is a growing obstacle.
