## The Role of Artificial Intelligence in QA Testing

AI has touched industries across the globe, offering unmatched capabilities and efficiencies—and software testing is no exception. Traditionally, QA testing heavily relied on time-intensive, manual processes that were prone to human error. As a response, automated testing arose, cutting down on manual effort but still requiring significant levels of scripting skills and ongoing maintenance.

With the rise of AI, QA testing entered a new phase. Advanced machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and intelligent systems redefine how applications are tested, making the process smarter, faster, and highly reliable. Zof AI exemplifies this cutting-edge approach by providing testing teams with tools and workflows optimized for modern needs, increasing productivity and enabling rapid software delivery.
