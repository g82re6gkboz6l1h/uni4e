## What Are AI Testing Frameworks?

AI testing frameworks use machine learning, predictive models, and automation to optimize software testing. Key functions include:
- Detecting and predicting bugs.
- Performing regression and performance tests.
- Validating user interfaces and experiences (UI/UX).

Unlike traditional scripts, AI tools evolve over time, creating adaptive testing environments that eliminate redundancy. Companies adopting these platforms will achieve faster development cycles and unparalleled quality benchmarks.
