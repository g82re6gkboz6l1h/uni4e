## What is Autonomous Testing?

**Autonomous testing** refers to AI-powered testing systems that require minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional manual or even automated testing methods, autonomous testing leverages machine learning (ML) to:

- Auto-generate test cases based on application and user insights.
- Detect bugs and inefficiencies accurately without pre-defined parameters.
- Adapt and evolve testing strategies over time as the software grows.
- Deliver actionable insights to empower QA professionals for efficient debugging.

By embracing autonomous testing, organizations can drastically reduce testing cycles, accelerate deployment timelines, and focus QA specialists on solving complex problems rather than repetitive tasks.
