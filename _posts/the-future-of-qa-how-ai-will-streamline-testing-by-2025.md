## Why QA Needs AI: Addressing the Challenges

Modern QA faces significant hurdles:

1. **Application Complexity**: Applications now feature intricate ecosystems, interconnected services, and diverse platforms. Testing manually is increasingly impractical.
2. **Fast Release Cycles**: Short timelines push QA teams to balance speed and thoroughness.
3. **High Costs**: Manual testing requires significant resources, especially for regression and compatibility testing.
4. **Risk of Human Error**: Mistakes can result in defects reaching production, harming user satisfaction.

AI’s ability to automate, learn, and adapt makes it the ideal solution to streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve outcomes.
