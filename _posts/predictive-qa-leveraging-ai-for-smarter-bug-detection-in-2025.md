## How Predictive QA Enhances Bug Detection

Traditional software testing relied on manual processes and automated tools that pinpointed defects after they appeared. Predictive QA evolves beyond reactive methods by using machine learning to foresee potential vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. It’s achieved through predictive analytics, including:

### 1. Pattern Recognition in Code
AI detects recurring patterns in historical data and identifies error-prone modules, preventing crashes like memory leaks before deployment.

### 2. Risk Prediction Linked to Code Changes
By analyzing developer activities and version control data, AI predicts high-risk areas subject to greater error probability, enabling targeted testing.

### 3. Proactive Testing Suggestions
Predictive QA prioritizes testing on high-risk components based on risk scores, optimizing QA workflows and reducing redundancy.
