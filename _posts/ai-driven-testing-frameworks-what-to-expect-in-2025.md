## What Are AI-Driven Testing Frameworks?

Traditional software testing relied heavily on manual or script-driven processes—unable to keep pace with rapid development cycles. AI-driven testing frameworks leverage machine learning (ML) and deep learning, making testing smarter and more adaptive. They autonomously identify edge cases, boost test coverage, and optimize testing workflows without the need for constant human intervention.

By reducing human error and automating repetitive test tasks, these innovative tools ensure high-quality codebases, particularly in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. In this article, we’ll explore why AI-driven testing frameworks will become an industry standard by 2025.
