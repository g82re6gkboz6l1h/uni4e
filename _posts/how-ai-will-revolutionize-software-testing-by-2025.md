## Challenges in Software QA

Agile practices and DevOps demand quick iteration and deployment. Yet, QA teams face obstacles:

- **Limited Test Coverage**: Manual methods can’t address growing application complexities.
- **Late Bug Detection**: Identifying bugs in later stages causes delays and costs.
- **Human Errors**: Manual testing introduces inaccuracies and inconsistencies.
- **Scalability Problems**: Large-scale, dynamic applications overwhelm traditional QA efforts.

AI tools offer solutions to speed testing, enable predictive insights, and improve outcomes.
