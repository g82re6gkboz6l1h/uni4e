## Manual and Automated Testing Challenges

Traditional testing methods face inherent inefficiencies:

### 1. **Human Error in Manual Testing**
Manual testing is prone to human oversight, time-consuming, and inadequate for assessing complex applications.

### 2. **Fragility of Automated Scripts**
Automated test scripts have low tolerance for updates, requiring frequent maintenance in dynamic environments.

### 3. **Limited Scalability**
Large applications strain testing workflows with traditional methods, making them non-scalable.

### 4. **Lack of Predictive Insights**
Manual and script-based testing lack data-driven foresight, often reacting to issues after deployment.

By addressing these gaps, AI enables streamlined QA workflows, proactive defect detection, and scalability.
