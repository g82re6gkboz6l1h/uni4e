## Key AI Technologies Transforming QA

### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
AI can now translate plain English into test cases using NLP technologies like GPT and BERT, eliminating human error and simplifying test generation. 

### 2. **Machine Learning (ML)**
ML enables predictive defect detection by analyzing trends in test results and identifying areas needing scrutiny.

### 3. **Self-Healing Algorithms**
These advanced systems dynamically adjust test scripts to align with changes in software elements, reducing maintenance.

### 4. **Computer Vision**
AI 'sees' graphical interfaces and verifies UI functionality contextually instead of relying on pixel-perfect validation.

### 5. **Reinforcement Learning**
Adaptive AI algorithms prioritize critical test cases autonomously, optimizing resources through iterative learning.
