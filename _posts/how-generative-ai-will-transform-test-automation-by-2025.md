## What Is Generative AI and Why Is It Critical for Software Testing?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, or code, based on vast datasets. By leveraging tools like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), generative AI automates complex tasks, including software test generation.

In software testing, generative AI can:
- Create test cases by analyzing application requirements and user stories.
- Predict potential failure points through machine learning.
- Generate reusable scripts tailored to application patterns.
- Mimic real-world scenarios for advanced testing accuracy.

By 2025, generative AI promises real-time adaptation to application updates, further optimizing testing workflows while reducing human intervention.
