## Introduction to the Future of QA with AI

The inclusion of artificial intelligence in software testing is not just progress—it's an evolution. Historically, QA relied heavily on manual interventions and standard automation to detect bugs, ensure performance stability, and optimize user experience. Despite being effective, these traditional methods involve substantial human time and effort.

AI shifts the landscape entirely by bringing intelligent systems capable of learning from data, analyzing patterns, and providing predictive insights. Powered by Machine Learning (ML), these advanced systems can process large datasets, studying application behavior and optimizing testing outcomes based on historical insights.

By 2025, AI in QA will move from innovation to essential infrastructure, enabling teams to meet fast-paced delivery cycles while ensuring superior accuracy and expansive test coverage.
