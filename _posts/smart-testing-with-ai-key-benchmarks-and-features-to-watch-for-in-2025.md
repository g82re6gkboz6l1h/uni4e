## Defining 'Smart Testing' in 2025: Intelligence Beyond Automation

Smart Testing goes beyond traditional automation by embedding intelligence into the testing lifecycle. It combines self-learning systems, predictive analytics, and adaptive algorithms to create a QA ecosystem that autonomously evolves. Core concepts include:

1. **Autonomy** – AI systems autonomously detect issues, adapt to changing requirements, and self-optimize.
2. **Context Awareness** – AI-driven tools prioritize critical testing areas, optimizing resource usage.
3. **Predictive Analytics** – Historical data is utilized to anticipate and resolve software flaws.
4. **Scalability** – Seamless adaptation to complex, growing testing environments.
