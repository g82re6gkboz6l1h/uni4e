## How AI Has Evolved QA Testing: From Automation to Autonomous Intelligence

Historically, QA testing relied on manual processes and pre-set automation frameworks like Selenium. While transformative, these approaches struggled with adapting to dramatic application changes or identifying issues beyond explicit checks.

AI's integration into QA began in the early 2020s, initially enhancing testing automation. By 2025, AI drives proactive QA strategies, autonomously crafting test plans and delivering unmatched accuracy in identifying software vulnerabilities.

### Predictive QA by 2025: Shifting from Reactive to Proactive Testing

AI algorithms analyze live and historical data to predict vulnerabilities before they occur, significantly reducing bug occurrence. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) demonstrate transformative predictive testing capabilities, offering anomaly anticipation and actionable insights for software optimization.
