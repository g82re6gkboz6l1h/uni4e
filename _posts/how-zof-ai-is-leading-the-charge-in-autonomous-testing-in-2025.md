## What is Autonomous Testing and Why Does it Matter?

Autonomous testing employs AI and machine learning (ML) to test, monitor, and evaluate software applications with minimal human involvement. Unlike traditional manual testing requiring time-intensive processes, autonomous testing:

- Automatically generates test cases by analyzing software behavior.
- Identifies and predicts potential failures before deployment.
- Continuously learns, adapting to optimize testing strategies.

This cutting-edge approach supercharges development cycles, enhances software reliability, cuts costs, and ensures faster time-to-market — key factors for businesses aiming to outpace competitors.
