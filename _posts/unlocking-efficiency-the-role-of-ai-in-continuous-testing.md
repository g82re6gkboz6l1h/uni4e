## Understanding Continuous Testing with AI

Continuous testing automates tests at every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). However, manual methods face bottlenecks such as time delays, human error, and scalability challenges. 

### Why AI is Critical for Efficiency:
- **Optimized Test Execution:** Prioritizes risk-based testing.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Pinpoints root causes faster.
- **Auto-Test Case Generation:** Reduces manual effort.
- **Improve Coverage:** Predicts failure-prone modules.
