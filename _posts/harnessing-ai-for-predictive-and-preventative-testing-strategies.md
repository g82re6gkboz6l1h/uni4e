## What Are Predictive and Preventative Testing Strategies?

Predictive and preventative testing methodologies proactively manage software risks during development and operations. Unlike traditional post-issue testing, predictive approaches utilize AI-powered analytics to forecast potential problems, while preventative strategies focus on mitigating risks early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Together, these methods ensure faster delivery, reduced defects, and superior software quality.
