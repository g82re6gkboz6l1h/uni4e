## Understanding Continuous Testing and DevOps

Continuous testing is vital to the DevOps lifecycle as it automates testing processes early and throughout development. It ensures faster defect detection while maintaining high-quality software delivery. By automating tests for every code update, DevOps teams can minimize risks, streamline workflows, and align with faster project cycles.

While DevOps fosters collaboration between development and operations with a focus on automation, continuous testing integrates effortlessly into this ecosystem. However, traditional approaches face challenges amid growing complexities in modern software processes. Enter AI—a transformative solution to deliver smarter, adaptive, and automated test strategies.
