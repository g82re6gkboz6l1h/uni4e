## Why AI is Transforming Software Testing

Testing was often manual labor, plagued by inefficiencies. While automation improved workflows, it lacked adaptability to modern demands. AI has stepped up, analyzing vast data sets in real time to detect and predict issues proactively. Unlike traditional methods, which tackle bugs reactively, AI prevents them from occurring altogether.

In today’s agile software development environment, constant updates can lead to bottlenecks. AI empowers developers with predictive insights, adaptive algorithms, and broad test coverage, ensuring quicker releases without compromising reliability or user satisfaction.
