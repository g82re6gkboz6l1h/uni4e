## Unlocking the Potential of Exploratory Testing in QA

Exploratory testing prioritizes human adaptability and creativity over following scripted steps. Testers dynamically interact with applications to discover bugs, making it a powerful tool for addressing UX and usability issues.

### Why Exploratory Testing Matters

1. **Discovering Hidden Bugs**: It excels at uncovering subtle defects missed by standard testing scripts.
2. **Human-Driven Insight**: Leverages human ingenuity for unique problem-solving and UX validation.
3. **Flexibility**: Adapts to ever-changing requirements and unexpected behaviors in real-world usage.

Despite its strengths, exploratory testing has historically struggled with scalability. AI bridges this gap, enhancing testing without sacrificing creativity.
