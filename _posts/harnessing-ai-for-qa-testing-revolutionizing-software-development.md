## What is AI in QA Testing, and How Does it Work?
Quality Assurance in software historically relied on manual methods or traditional automation, both of which have limits in cost, efficiency, and versatility. By incorporating AI, QA testing leverages machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to accelerate testing efforts, detect bugs, and proactively mitigate risks.

AI helps streamline testing processes by simulating user behaviors, analyzing large datasets for vulnerabilities, and adapting dynamically to evolving software requirements. Development teams using AI tools, like Zof AI, can anticipate user issues, improve accuracy, and ensure robust functionality across platforms.
