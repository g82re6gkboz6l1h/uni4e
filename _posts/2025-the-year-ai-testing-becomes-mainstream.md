## How AI Transforms Software Testing

For decades, QA has relied heavily on manual methods and basic automation tools. However, as software systems grow more complex, these traditional methods fall short. Manual testing is prone to human error, slower execution, and high costs, while static automation is limited in scope.

AI revolutionizes QA by using machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics. These advancements automate tasks such as test case generation, regression testing, and defect prediction. Platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) exemplify how AI maximizes efficiency and reliability in software testing. Today’s machine-powered testing doesn’t just assist human testers—it redefines how performance, functionality, and security are assessed.
