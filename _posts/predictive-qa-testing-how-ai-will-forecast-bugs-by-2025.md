## What is Predictive QA Testing?

Predictive QA testing uses AI to forecast bugs before they occur, shifting the traditional reactive testing model to a proactive approach. By leveraging machine learning, analyzing datasets, and identifying patterns of instability, predictive testing enables developers to anticipate vulnerabilities early in the cycle.

### AI’s Key Roles in Predictive QA Testing:
1. **Deep Data Analysis:** Machine learning algorithms analyze vast historical data to uncover bug trends.
2. **Pattern Recognition:** AI detects recurring code issues tied to specific functionalities.
3. **Anomaly Forecasting:** Predictive models identify future risks based on real-time signals.
4. **Automation:** AI autonomously initiates simulations and performance assessments.
