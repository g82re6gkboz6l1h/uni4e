## Traditional Agile Testing Challenges AI Addresses
1. **Limited Time for Testing:** Agile sprints often allow little room for exhaustive testing.
2. **Platform Complexity:** Testing across myriad devices and configurations requires more than manual methods.
3. **Human Error Risks:** Relying solely on manual QA processes increases inefficiencies.

AI tools revolutionize Agile testing by addressing these pain points. Their predictive and analytical strengths cut through complexity, enabling superior testing efficiency.
