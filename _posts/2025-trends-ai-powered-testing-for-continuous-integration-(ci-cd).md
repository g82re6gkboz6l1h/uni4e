## Key Insights on CI/CD Testing

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD automates code integration, testing, and deployment to optimize software delivery.

#### Benefits of CI/CD:
- Detect and fix errors early.
- Accelerate development cycles.
- Reduce manual interventions.

### Testing Bottlenecks in CI/CD Pipelines:
1. **Exponential Test Growth**: Increased test cases prolong build times.
2. **Flaky Tests**: Unstable tests disrupt workflows.
3. **Limited Resources**: Infrastructure constraints slow concurrent testing.
4. **Delayed Feedback**: Long test cycles hinder agility.
