## Evolution of AI in Software Testing 

The transformation of AI in QA began in the mid-2010s, initially automating repetitive tasks like regression testing and flaky test identification. Early AI tools, while time-saving, struggled with understanding complex logic and scalability. By 2023, advancements in AI and machine learning (ML) started enabling QA systems to learn from test results, predict code bottlenecks, and even generate test cases. The stage was set for tools like **Zof AI** to take center stage.

In 2025, **AI isn’t assisting testers; it’s driving QA**. Tools like Zof AI leverage cutting-edge processing power and autonomy to tackle challenges traditional solutions cannot address.
