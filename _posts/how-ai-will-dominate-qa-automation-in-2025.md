## Current Challenges in QA Automation

QA automation employs scripts and frameworks to execute testing tasks, providing scalability, reduced manual intervention, and better efficiency. Yet, traditional methodologies face persistent obstacles:

1. **High Maintenance Costs**: Automation scripts need updates as software evolves, increasing maintenance expenses.
2. **Coverage Gaps**: These frameworks often fail to account for nuanced scenarios or edge cases.
3. **Error-Prone Processes**: Manual oversight can lead to errors, lowering reliability overall.
4. **Prolonged Testing Times**: Relying on static scripts inhibits efficiency, especially in environments with rapid application changes.

AI-driven tools are strategically designed to eliminate these issues as we move into 2025.
