## Challenges in Traditional Performance Testing

### 1. **Time-Intensive Testing**
Manual testing involves prolonged processes that hinder swift development cycles. Simulating diverse load conditions is slow and resource-heavy.

### 2. **Scalability Limitations**
Global user bases demand systems capable of managing millions of interactions. Traditional tools falter in recreating real-world traffic demands at scale.

### 3. **Human Errors**
Manually written scripts and biased result interpretations lead to flawed data, which impacts decision-making.

### 4. **High Costs**
From expensive hardware to increased personnel engagement, scalability often comes with sky-high costs.

### 5. **Delayed Feedback**
Slow report generation pushes critical insights too late into the lifecycle resulting in inefficient workload adjustments.
