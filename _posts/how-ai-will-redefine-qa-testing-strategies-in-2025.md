## Traditional QA Testing Challenges: The Roadblocks

Though QA testing methodologies blend manual efforts and automation, outdated strategies exhibit significant inefficiencies:

### 1. **Time Restrictions and Delays**
Manual testing demands substantial time and labor, causing slower project turnaround and market delays.

### 2. **Human Oversights**
Manual test processes are prone to mistakes, risking undetected bugs in live environments despite best efforts.

### 3. **Static Automated Scripts**
Automation relies on static test scripts, requiring frequent updates to adapt to software changes, hindering scalability.

### 4. **Lack of Proactive Testing**
Traditional QA remains reactive, identifying issues post-deployment, increasing development costs and inefficiencies.

These challenges necessitate innovation—enter AI-powered QA strategies.
