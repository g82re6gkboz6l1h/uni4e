## Why Risk-Based Testing Matters

Risk-based testing has become a critical QA methodology, enabling teams to prioritize test cases based on defect probability and user impact. Instead of exhaustive testing, which is often impractical, risk-based testing ensures essential areas get the attention they need, aligning with fast-paced development cycles.

However, traditional methods rely heavily on human judgment and static historical data—failing to scale effectively with modern software complexity. Predictive analytics and AI address these challenges by automating risk detection and enabling dynamic, accurate test prioritization.
