## Traditional QA Challenges

Before AI transformations, traditional QA processes faced significant obstacles:

1. **Time-Intensive Testing**: Manual efforts in creating, updating, and executing tests elongated development cycles, especially with multiple iterative runs.
2. **Human Errors**: Even expert QA professionals are prone to mistakes when manually processing complex or large data sets.
3. **Inadequate Test Coverage**: Testing for every potential use case was challenging, leaving risky vulnerabilities unaddressed.
4. **Scalability Issues**: Traditional methods struggle to meet the growing demands for complex software.
5. **Reactive Fixes**: QA teams often focused on addressing issues post-development rather than preventing them entirely.
