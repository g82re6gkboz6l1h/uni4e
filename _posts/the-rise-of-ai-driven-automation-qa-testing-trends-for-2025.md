## The Evolution of Automation in QA Testing

Automation has been central to QA testing for years but is now becoming more intelligent thanks to AI. Early automated testing relied on scripted processes, demanding human involvement for updates and maintenance. Tools such as Selenium revolutionized automation but retained limitations, including test flakiness.

AI takes automation a step further. It introduces intelligent frameworks capable of analyzing massive datasets to identify trends, update scripts automatically, and proactively prevent failures. This paradigm shift is fundamentally transforming quality assurance approaches.
