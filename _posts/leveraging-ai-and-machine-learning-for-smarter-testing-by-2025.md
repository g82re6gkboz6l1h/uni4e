## The Role of AI and ML in Redefining Software Testing

Traditional testing largely relied on manual effort for tasks like writing and maintaining test cases or performing repetitive regression tests. With increasing demands for scalability and speed, companies are embracing AI and ML to address these challenges.

### Key Benefits of AI and ML in Testing
- Automation of repetitive tasks like regression and performance testing.
- Faster, predictive test-case creation.
- Proactive detection and prevention of bugs.
- Streamlined workflows for faster deliveries.
- Reduced dependency on manual inputs, minimizing errors.

By analyzing vast datasets, AI-powered tools uncover patterns that would go unnoticed by humans. Predictive analytics, for instance, can help developers identify bug-prone areas before launching applications. Companies adopting AI-led testing frameworks can outperform traditional counterparts and drive innovation.
