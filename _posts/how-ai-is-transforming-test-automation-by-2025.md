## Transformative Advancements in AI-Powered Test Automation

AI has modernized test automation, offering dynamic, efficient, and adaptive testing. Traditional methods relied heavily on manual maintenance but AI-based tools minimize human effort by adapting to changes within applications, often autonomously. 

Self-healing scripts, driven by technologies like machine learning, enable these tools to correct test cases automatically when application interfaces or APIs are updated. This automation ensures reduced test maintenance, enhanced accuracy, and increased speed. With algorithms learning from large datasets, AI systems intelligently prioritize high-risk areas, optimize test coverage, and focus on fault-prone modules.
