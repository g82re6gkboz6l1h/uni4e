## What is Regression Testing?

Regression testing re-evaluates software after updates, ensuring previous functionalities remain unaffected and errors aren’t introduced. QA teams re-test crucial areas to maintain stability and reliability. Common scenarios include:

- **Bug Fixes:** Guaranteeing issues don’t reappear.
- **Feature Updates:** Verifying new features integrate seamlessly.
- **Performance Enhancements:** Ensuring optimizations don't harm stability.
- **Environment Changes:** Confirming system reliability after infrastructure migration.
