## Manual vs. AI-Driven QA: A Paradigm Shift

Manual software testing has been indispensable for ensuring product quality, relying on QA professionals to craft test cases, execute them, and analyze results. However, manual methods often struggle to keep up with modern agile practices, CI/CD demands, and increasing development complexity. 

Enter AI-powered testing. By harnessing the power of machine learning, predictive analytics, and process automation, AI can identify defects faster, optimize test coverage, and enhance overall efficiency. Unlike manual testing, AI complements human expertise, transforming QA processes into highly adaptive and intelligent systems.
