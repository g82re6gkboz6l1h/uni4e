## Addressing Traditional QA Challenges with AI

Traditional QA practices face critical issues like:

1. **Time Constraints:** Manual testing often falls short in Agile/DevOps environments with rapid release schedules.
2. **Error Overlook:** Bugs or edge cases can escape undetected due to human limitations.
3. **Limited Scope:** Achieving expansive test coverage manually drains resources.
4. **Communication Silos:** Inefficient collaboration between QA and development teams delays problem resolution.
