## From Basic Automation to AI-Driven Testing

Automation has long been a staple in QA, executing pre-written scripts to validate functionality. However, it relies heavily on human input, with limited adaptability. AI goes beyond mere execution by learning from historical bugs, analyzing risks, and optimizing operations dynamically. AI algorithms predict issues before they affect production, enabling quicker, smarter, and more dynamic testing. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are already saving valuable time and enhancing accuracy with intelligence-driven workflows.
