## Challenges of Traditional Software Testing

### 1. **Manual Testing Bottlenecks**
Manual testing is labor-intensive and prone to errors, slowing down agile workflows.

### 2. **Fragile Automation Scripts**
Pre-scripted automation breaks easily with dynamic UI changes, requiring frequent maintenance.

### 3. **Missed Coverage and Edge Cases**
Standard testing struggles to predict unforeseen scenarios, risking bugs in production.

### 4. **Scaling Issues with Complex Architectures**
Adaptation to microservices or cloud platforms poses challenges for outdated testing methods.
