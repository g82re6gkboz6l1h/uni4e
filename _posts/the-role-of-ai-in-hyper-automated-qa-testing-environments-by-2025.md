## What is Hyper-Automation in QA Testing?

Hyper-automation combines cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning (ML), and robotic process automation (RPA) to automate testing processes. Unlike traditional QA, hyper-automation directs end-to-end testing cycles with minimal human intervention, using intelligent systems to deliver continuous testing, predictive analytics, and error detection. 

This approach simplifies validation from requirement gathering to regression testing, ensuring consistency across multiple platforms and applications. By 2025, hyper-automation will reduce time-to-market, improve scalability, and elevate software reliability—driving competitive advantages for enterprises.
