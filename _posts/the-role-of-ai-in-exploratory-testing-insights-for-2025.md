## What is Exploratory Testing and How is it Evolving?

Exploratory testing emphasizes adaptability and creativity over predefined scripts. By relying on their expertise, testers probe software for vulnerabilities and gauge robustness on the fly. But as software complexity rises and development timelines shrink, QA demands faster, smarter, and more insightful testing methods.

This evolving landscape highlights the transformative role of AI. While human testers excel in creativity and intuition, AI complements by offering rapid data analysis and actionable insights, enabling exploratory testing to scale effectively.
