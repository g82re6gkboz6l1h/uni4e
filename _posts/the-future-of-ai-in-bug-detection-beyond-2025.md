## Evolution of AI in Identifying Bugs and Errors

For decades, debugging relied on static analysis tools, unit testing, and manual processes. While effective, these methods required significant effort and often missed hidden defects. 

AI changes this. Modern machine learning algorithms enable automated systems that rapidly analyze code, accurately detect patterns, and shift from reactive to proactive debugging. Key advancements include:

- Prioritizing bugs by severity.
- Interpreting code context beyond syntax.
- Identifying environment-specific issues.

These developments are redefining software development and quality assurance, enabling faster, more precise bug detection.
