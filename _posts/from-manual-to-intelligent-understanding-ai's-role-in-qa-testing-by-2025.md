## The End of Manual Testing: AI’s Disruption in QA

Manual testing, once pivotal, faces significant challenges—slow processes, limited scalability, and human errors—making it inadequate for modern software complexities. AI fills this gap by automating repetitive tasks, analyzing vast data volumes, and enabling better test coverage in real-time. AI transforming testing:
- Machine Learning (ML) detects anomalies faster.
- Dynamic adaptability for seamless operational conditions.
- Reduction in manual efforts while enhancing accuracy.

By 2025, intelligent QA replaces traditional approaches, enabling faster software deployment and improved reliability.
