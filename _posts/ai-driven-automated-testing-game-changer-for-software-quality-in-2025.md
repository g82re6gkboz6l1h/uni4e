## Introduction to AI in Automated Testing

Automated testing has long been relied upon to improve efficiency during Quality Assurance (QA) processes. Traditionally dependent on rule-based configurations, it still required substantial human oversight. Enter AI-powered technologies, where **machine learning** and **natural language processing** (NLP) redefine the boundaries of what automated testing can achieve.

Through adaptive and predictive capabilities, AI frameworks now self-optimize, streamline workflows, and analyze defects. What was once unimaginable, such as auto-healing test scenarios, has become a fundamental feature of platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai).
