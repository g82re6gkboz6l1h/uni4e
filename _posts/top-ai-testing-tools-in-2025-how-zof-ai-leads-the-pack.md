## The Need for AI Testing Tools

The last decade has seen exponential growth in AI applications, from machine learning algorithms powering recommendations to advanced AI systems enhancing operations. However, reliance on AI invites scrutiny as issues such as bias, adversarial vulnerabilities, and lack of transparency increase. AI testing tools have become essential for mitigating risks, building trust, and ensuring models meet ethical standards. The industry’s projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 30% by 2025 reflects this growing demand.
