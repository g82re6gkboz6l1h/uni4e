## AI vs. Traditional Testing: Key Comparisons

### Manual Testing: A Legacy Approach
Manual testing has been the backbone of QA for years. Testers manually execute and analyze test cases, relying heavily on skill and expertise. Though adept at identifying intricate UI issues, it’s time-consuming, costly, and error-prone.

### Traditional Automated Testing: The Midway Solution
Automation tools such as Selenium and JUnit brought advancements by automating repetitive tasks. However, these tools rely on rigid scripts, which are hard to maintain and struggle to adapt to software updates.

### AI-Powered Testing: Redefining QA
AI testing leverages machine learning and predictive analytics to assess applications dynamically. These tools optimize testing workflows, predict bugs, and adapt easily to software updates. Here's an overview:

| **Testing Aspect**       | **Manual**       | **Traditional Automation** | **AI Testing**      |
|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Execution Speed**      | Slow             | Moderate                   | Fast                |
| **Scalability**          | Limited          | Moderate                   | High                |
| **Adaptability**         | High (Human)     | Low (Rigid Scripts)        | High (AI-Driven)    |
| **Error Risk**           | High             | Low                        | Very Low            |
