## Key Challenges in Traditional QA

Traditional QA faces obstacles that hinder efficiency and scalability. Among them:

- **Manual Testing**: QA teams spend excessive time on repetitive tasks like cross-environment tests. Scaling manual testing is often impractical.
- **Human Errors**: Missed bugs and imperfections bring risks for production.
- **Limited Time for Testing**: Agile software releases often constrain resources allocated for QA.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Diverse user bases and device configurations overwhelm traditional QA methods.
- **Limited Insights from Testing**: Traditional testing fails to generate actionable insights due to data-processing limitations.

AI-powered QA platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) overcome these challenges, offering smarter, faster, and scalable solutions.
