## The Rise of AI in QA Testing

### From Manual Testing to Automation

In the era of manual testing, human testers conducted repetitive tasks like executing scripts, detecting bugs, and reviewing code. While thorough, this approach was error-prone and time-consuming. The introduction of automated testing, featuring tools like Selenium and JUnit, reduced manual effort; however, these tools required substantial human input for creating and maintaining test scripts, limiting flexibility.

### AI’s Influence on QA

AI takes testing to a whole new level. By using machine learning algorithms and predictive data analysis, AI-powered tools eliminate the need for static testing processes. They adapt to new software configurations and learn from historical data, predicting vulnerabilities and finding errors faster than ever. Platforms like Zof AI are at the cutting edge, pushing QA beyond traditional boundaries with intelligent and scalable solutions.
