## What Are AI-Driven Testing Frameworks?

AI-driven testing frameworks combine machine learning, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation to enhance traditional QA. These frameworks not only detect issues but also adapt and learn from application behaviors, user interactions, and past data for increased precision and efficiency.

In the age of continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), AI frameworks enable real-time testing analysis, optimize test coverage, and ensure rapid releases without compromising quality. They represent a vital shift towards smarter, faster QA solutions that outpace conventional testing methods.
