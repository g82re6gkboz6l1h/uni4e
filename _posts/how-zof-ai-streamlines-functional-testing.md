## Common Challenges in Functional Testing

Functional testing verifies an application’s functionalities meet user requirements. However, it’s not without its hurdles:

1. **Complexity of Test Scenarios**: Applications integrate multiple layers, including APIs, databases, and third-party services. This makes creating exhaustive test cases incredibly intricate.
2. **Manual Testing Inefficiencies**: Manual execution of repetitive actions drains time and increases human error.
3. **Dynamic Development Cycles**: Agile development introduces ever-evolving requirements that make manual adjustments cumbersome.
4. **Inadequate Scalability**: Traditional methods often fail to simulate broad user scenarios when systems scale.
5. **Resource Constraints**: With tight deadlines and limited budgets, comprehensive testing becomes unfeasible.

**AI-powered tools like Zof AI address these obstacles**, reshaping how businesses approach functional testing.
