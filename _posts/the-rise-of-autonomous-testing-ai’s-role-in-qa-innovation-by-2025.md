## AI’s Pivotal Role in Autonomous Testing

### Machine Learning
Machine learning drives smarter test case generation, dynamic coverage optimization, and deep risk analysis. Testing systems evolve alongside the software, ensuring that quality adapts to code changes.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Human-readable test scripts become a reality with NLP. AI bridges communication gaps between technical and non-technical teams, fostering seamless collaboration.

### Predictive Analytics
Proactively identify potential bugs and prioritize high-risk test cases through machine learning predictive models — saving time and minimizing errors at scale.
