## Common Challenges in Software Testing

Software testing ensures the quality and reliability of applications. However, modern development processes face significant hurdles:

### 1. **Shortened Development Cycles**
Agile and DevOps methodologies require rapid iterations, leaving little time for exhaustive testing. Traditional methods often can’t keep up, increasing the risk of defects in production.

### 2. **Scalability Issues**
Testing across multiple platforms, devices, and environments leads to an overwhelming volume of test cases. Manual and basic automation methods struggle to scale efficiently.

### 3. **Frequent Maintenance**
Constant updates to software can break test scripts, requiring frequent revision and additional resources.

### 4. **Limited Bug Prediction**
Most traditional testing is reactive, focusing on defects after code development rather than anticipating vulnerabilities.

### 5. **High Costs**
Resource allocation, infrastructure demands, and manual testing labor make software testing expensive and time-consuming.
