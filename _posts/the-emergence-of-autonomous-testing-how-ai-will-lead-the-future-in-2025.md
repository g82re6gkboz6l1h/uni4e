## What is Autonomous Testing?

Autonomous testing harnesses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create self-operating systems that adapt dynamically to software changes—without requiring manual intervention. Unlike traditional automated testing, which depends on predefined scripts, autonomous systems evolve over time, continuously optimizing processes.

By 2025, AI-led testing minimizes repetitive tasks, reduces manual overhead, and ensures seamless product releases. These systems also identify edge cases, respond to code updates with self-healing capabilities, and utilize **natural language processing (NLP)** to make testing accessible for non-technical team members.

For example, QA engineers no longer need to write extensive scripts. AI-powered systems autonomously generate, execute, and analyze tests based on historical data, making the testing process smarter and more adaptive.
