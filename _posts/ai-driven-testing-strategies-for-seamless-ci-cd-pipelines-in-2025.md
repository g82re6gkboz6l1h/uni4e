## The Evolution of CI/CD with AI
Traditional CI/CD workflows rely heavily on automated testing frameworks, which often struggle with debugging issues and identifying unforeseen edge cases. AI-driven testing addresses these limitations:

- **Simulating Real-World Scenarios**: AI tests applications under various conditions to validate performance.
- **Reducing Human Intervention**: Automated self-adjusting tests provide instant insights and adaptability.
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI can catch subtle system deviations, identifying bugs before they escalate.
