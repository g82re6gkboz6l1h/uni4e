## Why Traditional Automation Falls Short in Modern Testing
Automation excels in repetitive processes, ensuring reliable application verification, yet struggles with the complexities of today’s tech environments:

1. **Limited Coverage**: Most scripts fail to account for dynamic scenarios or edge cases, leaving potential issues unresolved.
2. **High Maintenance**: Frequent UI or behavior updates result in fragile scripts requiring constant upkeep.
3. **Static Performance**: Automation tools lack adaptability; trends or system changes go unnoticed.
4. **Data Overload**: Automation struggles to interpret massive datasets, missing critical insights hidden in logs.

AI bridges these gaps, positioning itself as the ultimate solution for modern automated testing challenges.
