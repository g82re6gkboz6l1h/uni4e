## Traditional vs. Modern Testing Approaches

### Limitations of Manual Testing
Historically, QA relied on tedious manual processes: testing strategies, regression testing, and dynamic static execution. These methods, while effective, fell short in scalability, speed, and error reduction for today’s complex software demands. 

### Automation Testing: An Incomplete Step
Automation tools like Selenium and JUnit marked a major improvement by reducing manual workloads, yet they still demanded heavy scripting efforts. Unpredictable issues, such as user behavior or real-time error identification, remained unsolved.
