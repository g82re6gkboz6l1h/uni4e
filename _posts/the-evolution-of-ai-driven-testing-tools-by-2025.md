## How AI Has Transformed Testing Over the Years

### From Manual Testing to Automated Processes
Initially, testing processes relied heavily on manual execution—a time-consuming and error-prone effort. The introduction of automation frameworks like Selenium and JUnit marked the first major evolution. While automation reduced repetitive tasks, it required extensive scripting efforts by developers.

In the early phase of AI integration, testing tools struggled to unlock AI's full potential due to technical limitations and insufficient expertise. By the 2020s, however, adaptive AI models began reshaping QA tools, offering predictive analysis, dynamic bug detection, and autonomous regression testing.

### 2025: AI Drives a Testing Revolution
Fast-forward to 2025, AI-powered tools are now central to QA workflows. Cutting-edge solutions like **Zof AI** are enabling testers to achieve automation-driven scalability, intelligent defect identification, and continuous insights—all while reducing time-to-market.
