## What is Predictive QA? Why Should You Care? 
Predictive QA is a proactive testing method leveraging machine learning, data analytics, and AI algorithms. Unlike traditional reactive testing, predictive QA prevents errors through analysis of historic bug data, past testing trends, and user feedback—saving time, reducing costs, and minimizing development risks.

**Why Predictive QA Matters:**
1. Faster Software Development Cycles
2. Reduced Expenses Linked to Late Fixes
3. Enhanced Collaboration Across Teams
4. Better Compliance for High-Stakes Industries
5. Improved User Experience and Customer Retention
