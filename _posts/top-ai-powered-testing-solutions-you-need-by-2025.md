## The Journey to AI Testing: From Manual to Intelligent QA

Historically, software testing evolved through distinct phases:

1. **Manual Testing (Pre-2000s)**: Slow, error-prone, and resource-heavy.
2. **Scripted Automation (2000s)**: Tools like Selenium offered automation for repetitive tasks but came with high maintenance costs.
3. **Codeless Solutions (2010s)**: User-friendly platforms with drag-and-drop functionality made QA more accessible.
4. **AI-Powered Testing (Post-2020)**: Artificial intelligence enables software testing to be predictive, adaptive, and faster than ever before.

AI-powered solutions like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) leverage historical test data to predict weak points and recommend optimizations in real time, setting a new benchmark for innovation in the QA industry.
