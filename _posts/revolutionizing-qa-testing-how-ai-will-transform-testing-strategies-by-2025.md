## The Rise of AI in QA Testing
Traditional QA often relied on repetitive manual processes and automated frameworks. Although automation streamlined workflows, tasks such as defining test cases and analyzing results still required significant human input. AI shifts this paradigm by introducing adaptive machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics. With these capabilities, AI tools autonomously handle regression testing, generate real-time test cases, detect intricate bugs, and optimize test execution. This boosts precision, scalability, and strategic focus within QA teams.
