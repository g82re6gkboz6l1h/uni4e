## The Evolution of AI in Software Testing

### From Manual to AI-Driven Testing

Early software testing was manually intensive, with QA analysts painstakingly detecting defects. Challenges like scalability and short deadlines fueled the rise of traditional automation tools, such as Selenium and Appium. While efficient, these tools lacked the adaptive capabilities needed for modern agile development.

AI-powered QA tools revolutionized the industry by introducing intelligent features: learning application behavior, identifying defect patterns, and generating predictive test cases. Unlike traditional tools, AI can adapt dynamically to changing code environments, ensure better test coverage, and highlight risks proactively. The trajectory of AI adoption is setting the stage for unprecedented improvements by 2025.
