## Understanding Autonomous Testing and AI’s Role in It

**Autonomous testing** is a transformative process where AI automates the software testing life cycle (STLC). Unlike traditional test automation that depends on scripts and manual updates, autonomous testing employs advanced algorithms to generate, execute, and adapt test cases completely independently.

### Why AI is Key to Autonomous Testing

1. **Self-Learning Capabilities**: AI enables systems to analyze patterns, adapt testing processes, and evolve based on performance and user feedback.
2. **Minimal Human Intervention**: AI dynamically adjusts test cases to application changes, significantly reducing manual input.
3. **Scalable Testing**: With the complexity of modern software ecosystems, AI effectively manages large-scale interconnected systems, APIs, and microservices.
