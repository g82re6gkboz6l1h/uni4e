## The Evolution of AI in Software Testing  

Software testing is pivotal for ensuring applications operate smoothly and are free from bugs. Traditional manual and semi-automated testing required immense time and effort, but as systems became more complex, these methods became insufficient.

AI transformed testing by automating repetitive tasks, predicting bugs, and adapting dynamically. Key developments include:  

- **From rules-based systems to machine learning-powered tools:** AI systems now learn and adapt based on data rather than relying solely on manual input.
- **Self-healing test scripts:** Broken scripts get automatically fixed as applications evolve.
- **Predictive analytics:** Tools proactively identify potential defects and optimize testing strategies.

Organizations utilizing AI-powered testing consistently achieve faster release cycles, enhanced quality, and reduced costs.
