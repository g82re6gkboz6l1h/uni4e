## What is AI-Powered Testing?

AI-powered testing leverages artificial intelligence technologies like machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate and enhance every aspect of software testing. Unlike manual or scripted testing, AI testing adapts dynamically, detecting patterns and anomalies in data to identify bugs and potential vulnerabilities effectively. This innovative testing model ensures:

- **Enhanced Bug Detection**: With real-time identification of bugs and root causes.
- **Streamlined Test Automation**: Minimized manual intervention and improved adaptability.
- **Optimized Regression Testing**: Prioritization of test cases based on impacted areas, saving time and resources.
- **Superior Performance Monitoring**: Predicting and addressing performance bottlenecks efficiently.
