## Why Does AI Face Challenges in Software Testing?

While AI has revolutionized testing through automation and predictive analytics, current systems have limitations:

### 1. **Understanding Complex Contexts**
AI struggles with nuanced user interactions and edge case identification, relying heavily on sophisticated training to replicate human understanding.

### 2. **Managing Dynamic System Changes**
Dynamic configurations in modern applications often require manual recalibration, slowing down automated testing pipelines.

### 3. **Bias & Error Generation**
AI models learning from flawed historical data may introduce biases and false positives, leading to wasted resources.

### 4. **Opaque Decision-Making**
With limited transparency, teams often mistrust the “black box” nature of AI testing tools, impacting full-scale adoption.
