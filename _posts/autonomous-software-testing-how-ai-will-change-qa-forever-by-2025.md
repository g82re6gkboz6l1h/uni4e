## Autonomous Software Testing: A Primer on AI-Driven Solutions

Autonomous software testing utilizes AI to automate traditional, manual—and often repetitive—QA tasks. Unlike script-based automation tools, AI-driven systems evolve dynamically. These systems can identify bugs, generate test cases, predict issues, and even self-repair broken tests caused by code changes.

At the core of these advancements lies AI’s strength in processing vast data sets, identifying functional patterns, and acting in real-time. Modern QA teams leveraging AI cut down hours spent creating, maintaining, or running tests. The result? Enhanced software quality and minimal human error.
