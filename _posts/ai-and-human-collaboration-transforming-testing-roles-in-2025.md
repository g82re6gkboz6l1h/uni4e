Why Human Testers are Essential Despite AI Advancements

Even with tools like Zof AI, human intuition, empathy, and contextual understanding remain indispensable. Here’s why:

- **Edge Case Interpretation:** AI struggles with unpredictable scenarios, where human problem-solving excels.
- **User-Centric Insight:** Humans think critically about user satisfaction, beyond mere functionality.
- **Ethical Judgments:** AI can detect bias, but moral decisions require human input.
- **Adaptation to Context:** Cultural nuances and social dynamics are best interpreted by human testers.

AI enhances efficiency but lacks the contextual intelligence that makes humans essential contributors to the process.
