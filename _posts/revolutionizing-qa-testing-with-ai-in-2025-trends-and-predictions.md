## How AI is Reshaping QA Testing

QA testing has historically relied on manual and semi-automated processes, which are often limited in speed and prone to human error. AI-driven testing frameworks are changing that narrative by enabling faster procedures, precise issue identification, and predictive capabilities. New technologies like machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) elevate QA testing strategies, offering predictive analytics to identify risks before testing begins and adaptive frameworks for real-time insights.
