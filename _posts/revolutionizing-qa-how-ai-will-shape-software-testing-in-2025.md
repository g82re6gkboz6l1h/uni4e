## How AI is Transforming QA and Evolving Software Testing

Software QA has transitioned from manual testing practices to advanced automated tools like Selenium and Appium. Despite automation’s benefits, it lacked true adaptability and required constant manual oversight.

With the advent of AI-powered tools, testing processes became progressively smarter. Early AI applications generated test cases autonomously and accelerated defect detection. By 2025, this evolution, led by platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), is enabling predictive testing, minimizing human intervention, and introducing proactive strategies to address bugs before they arise.

AI-driven QA shifts testing from reactive problem-solving to preventative quality assurance, fundamentally reshaping how development teams operate.
