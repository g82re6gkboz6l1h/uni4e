## Introduction: AI’s Role in Transforming QA

Quality Assurance has traditionally relied on manual testing and script-based automation—a resource-heavy process prone to human error. AI, however, leverages technologies like machine learning (ML), predictive analytics, and natural language processing (NLP) to revolutionize QA. It introduces smarter, faster, and more cost-efficient testing while delivering high-quality results.
