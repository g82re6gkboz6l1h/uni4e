## The Challenges of Manual QA Test Coverage

Effective test coverage is often constrained by the limitations of manual QA. Let’s break down the challenges faced by QA teams:

### 1. **Labor-Intensive Processes**
Manual test case generation and execution require significant time and human effort. Testing every possible scenario in complex systems can delay product releases, frustrating stakeholders and dev teams alike.

### 2. **Edge Cases Left Untested**
Human testers often prioritize common paths, leading to under-tested edge cases. Bugs in these overlooked scenarios frequently disrupt performance post-release.

### 3. **Human Errors in Repetitive Testing**
Repetition can lead to tester fatigue, increasing the likelihood of missed critical errors or overlooked regressions.

### 4. **Scaling Challenges**
Larger, feature-rich applications demand more robust QA efforts, posing scalability issues for manual teams working with limited resources.

Clearly, QA processes must evolve to address these challenges. Enter Zof AI.
