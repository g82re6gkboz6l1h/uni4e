## Common QA Challenges in Software Development

Software testing faces constant hurdles in modern development cycles. Explore the issues most QA teams encounter and how AI can help:

### **1. Tedious Manual Testing**
Manual test creation and execution make QA time-intensive and error-prone. Human limitations often cause delays and inconsistencies, impacting delivery timelines.

### **2. Lack of Scalability**
As codebases grow, manually conducted QA struggles to keep up, especially across platforms like desktop, mobile, and web.

### **3. Time-Consuming Regression Testing**
Revalidating previous functionality with every new update is a drain on time and resources, slowing development velocity.

### **4. Insufficient Test Coverage**
Critical bugs may be overlooked under pressure, risking costly failures in production.

### **5. Variability in Execution Quality**
Human fatigue and fluctuating team expertise lead to inconsistent testing outcomes, introducing unnecessary risks.

AI-powered tools like **Zof AI** minimize these challenges, enabling teams to focus on innovation and delivering high-quality software faster.
