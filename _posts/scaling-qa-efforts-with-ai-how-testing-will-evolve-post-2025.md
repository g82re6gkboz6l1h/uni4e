## The Challenges of Scaling QA Without AI

Traditional QA processes face several constraints, which become hurdles as organizations aim to scale their testing efforts:

### 1. **Human Limitations in Complex Systems**
Modern digital applications consist of interconnected features and voluminous data. Manual testing, prone to errors, becomes time-consuming and ineffective, delaying delivery timelines and impacting revenue.

### 2. **Agile Timelines and Testing Pressure**
With Agile development prioritizing rapid releases, solely relying on manual QA compromises testing coverage, making it difficult to keep up with sprint schedules.

### 3. **Inefficient Resource Scaling**
Scaling QA through traditional methods requires more personnel, which increases costs and creates inefficiencies in resource management for expanding projects.

### 4. **Surface-level Insights from Testing Data**
Manual testing often lacks the capability to analyze deep data patterns, leaving teams vulnerable to identifying potential risks late in the development pipeline.
