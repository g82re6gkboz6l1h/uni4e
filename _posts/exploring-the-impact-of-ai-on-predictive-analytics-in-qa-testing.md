## What Is Predictive Analytics in Software Testing?

Predictive analytics harnesses machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and historical data to forecast future behaviors and risks within software systems. In QA testing, predictive analytics proactively identifies potential defects or risk areas before they impact users.

Combining AI-driven insights with large data sets—drawn from past QA cycles, bug logs, and user feedback—predictive analytics enhances risk mitigation during development. QA teams can resolve issues preemptively, reducing redundancies and saving time while ensuring improved software reliability.
