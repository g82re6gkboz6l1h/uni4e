## Current Obstacles in QA Automation: Why AI is the Game-Changer

Despite its benefits, conventional QA automation presents numerous obstacles:

1. **Achieving Both Speed and Accuracy:** Automated testing is faster but often lacks precision in complex scenarios like end-to-end workflows, requiring manual intervention.
  
2. **Scalability Challenges:** As applications become more intricate with microservices, maintaining scalable automation becomes daunting.

3. **Tool Disparity:** Teams often employ disjointed tools, resulting in fragmented, error-prone workflows.

4. **Frequent Breakdowns Due to UI Changes:** Rapidly evolving apps mean test scripts often break with even minor updates.

5. **Limited Test Types:** Legacy testing tools overlook critical areas like performance and accessibility testing.

AI platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) solve such challenges by integrating adaptive intelligence, real-time problem solving, and predictive analytics. With Zof AI’s smart capabilities, QA teams can now test with unmatched precision, scalability, and efficiency.
