## Addressing Current QA Limitations

AI addresses some of QA's biggest pain points, including:

- **Manual Testing Delays:** Human dependency in testing is slow, especially for large-scale test environments.
- **Scalability Challenges:** Complex systems involving microservices and APIs overwhelm traditional frameworks.
- **Human Error:** Repetitive tasks lead to oversight, risking late-stage errors.
- **Reactive Testing Strategies:** Existing testing methods lack the foresight needed for proactive error prevention.

AI's ability to automate, predict, and improve opens the door to solving these bottlenecks, making QA efficient and forward-thinking.
