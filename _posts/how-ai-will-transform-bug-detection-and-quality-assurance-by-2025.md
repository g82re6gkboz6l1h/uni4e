## Current Challenges in QA and Bug Detection

Traditional QA methods face a variety of challenges that slow down software delivery and affect reliability. Here's a breakdown of the main obstacles:

### 1. Increasing Software Complexity
Modern applications often integrate technologies like microservices and cloud infrastructure, making QA more demanding. Testing compatibility across diverse setups is a significant hurdle.

### 2. Human Limitations
Manual testing frequently misses edge cases. Time constraints and pressure for rapid releases lead to quality compromises.

### 3. Shrinking Development Timelines
Continuous delivery cycles reduce QA time, leaving gaps in testing scope.

### 4. Regression Testing Inefficiencies
Repetitive manual regression testing consumes resources and creates bottlenecks, impacting deployment speed.
