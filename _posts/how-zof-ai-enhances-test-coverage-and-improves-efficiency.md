## What Is Test Coverage and Why Does It Matter?

**Test coverage** measures how much of your codebase is executed during testing. High test coverage ensures: 

- **Fewer production bugs:** Early bug detection avoids costly post-production fixes.
- **Lower maintenance costs:** Addressing root issues during development saves significant time and resources.
- **Better user experiences:** A stable, bug-free application delights end-users.

However, manually achieving comprehensive test coverage is challenging and often neglects edge cases—critical scenarios that can disrupt application functionality. This is where Zof AI steps in.

## Challenges with Traditional QA Methods

Traditional QA heavily relies on human-written test cases and scripts, which often fall short due to:

1. **Manual effort and time demands:** QA teams invest excessive hours writing, revising, and updating test cases.
2. **Blind spots in testing:** Human limitations may lead to overlooked errors, especially in complex systems.
3. **Static testing practices:** Evolving codebases demand dynamic and adaptable testing strategies, often missing in conventional methods.

These constraints highlight the need for a more modern, adaptable solution like Zof AI.
