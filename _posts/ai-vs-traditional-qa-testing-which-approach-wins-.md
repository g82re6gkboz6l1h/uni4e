## Key Differences Between Traditional QA and AI Testing Methods

### Traditional QA Insights
- Manual processes depend heavily on predefined rules and scripted automation.
- May struggle with complex iterative development cycles and evolving requirements.
- Prone to human error and less capable of identifying granular edge cases.

### AI-Driven QA Insights
- Uses advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms.
- Continuously evolves to adapt to new features without requiring reprogramming.
- Delivers instantaneous results, scaling efficiently with system complexity.
