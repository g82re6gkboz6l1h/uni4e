## What is Continuous Testing, and Why Does It Matter?
Continuous testing refers to the integration of automated tests at every stage of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Aimed at detecting flaws early in the pipeline, this approach is pivotal for Agile teams relying on CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) workflows.

### Core Principles of Continuous Testing:
- **Automation:** Reducing dependency on manual testing through advanced automation.
- **Early Detection:** Prioritizing the identification of issues in the earliest development phases.
- **Integrated Workflows:** Embedding testing seamlessly within CI/CD pipelines.
- **Rapid Feedback:** Providing actionable insights to foster iterative improvements.

These principles are essential but need scalability and intelligence to keep up with modern application complexities, such as microservices and cloud-based architectures. AI has now emerged as the key enabler for meeting these advanced requirements.
