## Understanding Predictive Testing: What and Why?

Predictive testing is an unparalleled QA approach, employing historical data, user pattern analysis, and machine learning algorithms to identify vulnerabilities before they manifest—essentially shifting QA from reactive to proactive. Unlike legacy testing methods which address bugs post-development, predictive testing ensures efficiency and accuracy by preempting potential risks in the software cycle.
