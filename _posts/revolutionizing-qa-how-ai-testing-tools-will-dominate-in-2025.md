## AI in Testing: A Game-Changer for QA 

In the past, software testing was largely manual, requiring immense effort from QA teams to detect bugs, validate system updates, and maintain test cases within tight deadlines. Tools like Selenium introduced automation into this process but still depended on considerable human intervention. AI has completely altered the landscape.

AI-powered tools leverage machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing (NLP) to automate repetitive tasks, identify anomalies, and self-heal broken test scripts. This ensures faster testing, reduced human error, and improved reliability. 

By 2025, advancements in AI integration and machine learning will embed smarter and more efficient tools into QA pipelines. Businesses will rapidly adopt these tools to achieve predictive, adaptive testing methods that evolve alongside software products.
