## What is AI in Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing?

Traditional QA workflows have relied heavily on manual analysis and execution, which often proves inadequate as software complexity increases. AI bridges the gap by applying machine learning, predictive analytics, and pattern recognition to automate processes. It enhances test coverage, detects errors faster, and adapts to system changes while upholding high accuracy standards.

Whether it's regression testing, performance evaluation, or security checks, AI-enabled solutions empower QA professionals to deliver better results. Companies around the world are now integrating these tools to meet dynamic market demands without compromising on quality.
