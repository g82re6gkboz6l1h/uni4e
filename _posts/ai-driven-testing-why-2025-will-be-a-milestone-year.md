## The Journey of AI in Software Testing

### From Automation to Intelligent Testing
Automation tools like Selenium paved the way for efficiency but lacked adaptability. Between 2018 and 2023, AI integration introduced machine learning algorithms for smarter predictions and scenario mapping, boosting QA processes. By 2025, AI systems are expected to autonomously manage testing workflows, offering real-time analytics to detect issues instantly.
