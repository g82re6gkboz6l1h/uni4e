## How AI is Evolving QA Strategies

Manual and automated testing—once the mainstays of QA—face increasing challenges with the complexity of modern software. Enter AI, which makes it possible to:

- **Predict Defects**: Identify potential bugs before they arise using historical data and user behavior.
- **Create Self-Healing Tests**: Adapt scripts automatically when changes occur in code or application interfaces.
- **Enhance Test Coverage**: Automatically generate test cases to maximize coverage and reduce redundancies.
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focus testing on areas with the highest impact and risk of failure.

AI enables smarter, faster, and more reliable QA workflows, ensuring software quality in an era of rapid digital transformation.
