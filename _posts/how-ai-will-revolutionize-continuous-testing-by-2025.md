## Why AI Is Essential for Modern Continuous Testing
Traditionally, continuous testing relied heavily on manual scripting and static automation tools, limiting its ability to proactively address risks and predict issues. AI enhances testing processes by:

- Predicting bugs through historical data patterns.
- Automatically generating dynamic test cases.
- Identifying anomalies in performance and user interactions.
- Automating repetitive tasks to free up testers for strategic workflows.

AI-powered testing frameworks like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) bring speed, precision, and intelligence to continuous testing, making it a more predictive and proactive process.
