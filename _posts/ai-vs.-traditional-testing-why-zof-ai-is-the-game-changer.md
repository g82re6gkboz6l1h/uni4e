## The Challenges of Traditional QA Testing

### **1. Time-Intensive Processes**
Traditional QA testing relies on manual test case creation, prioritization, and execution. With frequent software updates, QA teams face difficulties maintaining compatibility within tight timelines.

### **2. Human Errors and Oversights**
Manual testing introduces scope for mistakes: missed bugs, edge cases, or inadequate analysis can lower software reliability, leading to costly fixes later.

### **3. Limited Scalability**
Scaling tests effectively across complex systems or diverse environments is taxing and resource-draining.

### **4. High Costs**
Labor-intensive testing methods require sizable budgets for human resources and tools, reducing cost efficiency.

These challenges highlight the need for intelligent, automated, and scalable testing solutions.
