## The Transition from Manual Testing to AI-Powered Automation

Gone are the days when manual testers painstakingly hunted bugs step-by-step. Though effective, manual testing lacked scalability and efficiency. Enter automated testing tools, which allowed testers to write scripts for repetitive tasks, improving speed and consistency. Despite this progress, traditional automation tools relied heavily on static pre-written scripts, which struggled to adapt to dynamic application changes.

AI has disrupted this bottleneck by introducing self-learning mechanisms. Technologies like machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics empower AI systems to adapt, predict problem areas, and generate new test cases, allowing for continuous, intelligent testing that evolves alongside modern applications.
