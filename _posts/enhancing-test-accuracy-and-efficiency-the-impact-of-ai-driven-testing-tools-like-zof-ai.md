## The Limitations of Traditional Testing Methods

### **Manual Testing Challenges**
Human testers may simulate user behaviors, but manual testing remains labor-intensive, inconsistent, and prone to errors.

### **Automation Constraints**
While script-based automation speeds up testing, updating them becomes resource-draining due to frequent software changes. Moreover, these scripts lack the flexibility to adapt dynamically.

### **Scalability Bottlenecks**
Handling complex systems with vast databases and global users overwhelms traditional methodologies.

### **Lack of Predictive Insights**
Existing methods focus on bug detection post-production, increasing costs during late-stage issue fixes.
