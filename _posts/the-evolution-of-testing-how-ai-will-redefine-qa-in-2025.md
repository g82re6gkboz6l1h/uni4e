## Revolutionizing QA with AI: A New Paradigm

AI in testing isn’t about basic automation; it’s about intelligence. Machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics will discover issues beyond human scope, even in massive datasets. 

Already today, AI tools streamline defect predictions, enhance visual testing, optimize test coverage, and integrate into CI/CD pipelines. By 2025, these innovations will dominate industry standards.
