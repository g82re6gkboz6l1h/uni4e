## Current Challenges in Regression Testing

Today’s software teams grapple with significant hurdles in regression testing, leading to inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the development process. Below are the key issues that plague traditional regression testing methods:

### Manual Test Creation and Maintenance
Manually designing and updating test cases to ensure software stability is both time-consuming and costly. Frequent application updates necessitate constant test case revision, making this approach unsustainable in dynamic development cycles.

### Scalability Struggles
As applications grow in complexity, the number of test cases naturally multiplies. This creates a scalability issue, where even minor code changes require comprehensive testing across interconnected modules, delaying timelines.

### Flaky Tests
Flaky tests yield inconsistent results, creating confusion and often disguising critical defects. They waste QA team resources and reduce confidence in the test suite.

### Resource Overuse
Regression testing demands substantial developer and computational resources. Many teams struggle to allocate these resources efficiently, compromising on speed and test coverage.

### Limited Insights
Traditional regression testing provides limited analytics, offering little visibility into failure diagnostics, test coverage, and optimization areas.
