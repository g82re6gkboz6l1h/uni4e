## Key Challenges in Traditional Regression Testing

### Why Traditional Methods Fall Short

- **Time-Intensive**: Growing systems inflate test suites. Extensive testing delays delivery.
- **Human Error**: Manual testing leads to blind spots and errors.
- **Resource-Heavy**: High resource usage diverts attention from key innovations.
- **Prioritization Issues**: Identifying relevant tests remains a struggle.
- **Regressions Hard to Detect**: Pinpointing errors with precision is painstaking.

AI emerges as the solution, promising automated precision, better insights, and increased efficiency.
