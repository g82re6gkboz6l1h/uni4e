## Common Challenges in Existing Testing Methods

### 1. **Time and Resource Intensive**
Manual and traditional automation testing demands time and expertise for test creation and maintenance—especially within shifting codebases.

### 2. **Escalating Costs**
From hiring QA teams to upkeep tools, traditional testing methods strain resources, especially for growing enterprises.

### 3. **Script Flakiness**
Frequent updates in business logic or UIs lead to unreliable test scripts and high maintenance workloads.

### 4. **Partial Coverage**
Complex edge cases often slip through untested due to resource constraints.

### 5. **Limited Defect Detection**
Dynamic workflows and anomalies remain undetected by hardcoded and outdated testing procedures.
