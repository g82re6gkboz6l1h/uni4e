## Why AI in QA Testing Is Non-Negotiable

Achieving full test coverage has long been a challenge because traditional manual testing methods often fail to address edge cases or rare scenarios due to time and human limitations. By integrating AI-driven tools, development teams can:

- Detect coding gaps proactively.
- Automate both dynamic and routine testing.
- Achieve seamless CI/CD integration.
  
Discover tools and methodologies used to meet evolving QA benchmarks.
