## Why Traditional QA Needs a Shake-Up

Traditional QA methods struggle with several challenges:

### Common Pain Points in Manual Testing

1. **Time and Resource Limitations**: Manual testing methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, causing bottlenecks in fast-paced development cycles.
2. **Human Error**: Repeated processes often lead to subjective errors due to fatigue or oversight, sacrificing precision.
3. **Complex Ecosystems**: Modern software integrates across APIs, IoT, and cloud services, making manual testing inefficient for detecting errors.
4. **Agility Demands**: Agile and DevOps frameworks require quicker iterations, leaving testing resources under immense pressure.
5. **Dynamic Threats**: Growing cybersecurity vulnerabilities and regulatory updates make traditional methodologies insufficient to predict or adapt to new risks.
