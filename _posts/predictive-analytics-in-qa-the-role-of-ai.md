### **Key Applications in QA**

Predictive analytics has transformed QA practices with these applications:
1. **Defect Prediction**: Identify high-risk areas in code to preempt bugs.
2. **Resource Optimization**: Prioritize testing activities for maximum coverage.
3. **Tailored Test Cases**: Enhance defect detection through scenario-based testing.
4. **Release Risk Reduction**: Mitigate risks before production rollouts using actionable insights.

## **AI's Role in Defect Prediction & Prevention**

AI streamlines QA by analyzing vast data sets, uncovering hidden patterns, and automating defect management. Machine learning algorithms predict defects, severity levels, and potential failures well before they impact user experience.

### **Preventing Issues with AI**
AI facilitates defect prevention through:
- **Proactive Code Alerts**: Developers refine code with AI-suggested improvements.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Tools like Zof AI identify runtime discrepancies early.
- **Risk-Based Resource Allocation**: Direct QA efforts efficiently to high-risk modules.
