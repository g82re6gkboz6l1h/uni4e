## What Is AI-Driven Continuous Testing?

Continuous testing involves automated tests running throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Unlike periodic or isolated testing, it enables real-time validation and issue detection across every phase. Integrating **AI** into this method transforms efficiency and intelligence, enhancing processes through:

- **Predictive analytics:** AI forecasts potential failure points using historical and real-time data.
- **Self-healing scripts:** AI dynamically adjusts test scripts in response to changes in code or app interfaces.
- **Data insights:** Machine learning extracts actionable patterns, helping refine code faster.

Platforms such as **Zof AI** (https://zof.ai) showcase intelligent solutions, demonstrating how AI-driven tools redefine agile testing and foster innovation.
