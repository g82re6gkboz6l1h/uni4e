## Top Challenges QA Teams Face in Software Testing

While QA is indispensable in ensuring the success of software products, teams often encounter common hurdles:

### 1. **Time Crunch in Testing**  
Manual regression and repetitive testing consume valuable time, forcing teams to skip tests or miss edge cases under tight deadlines.

### 2. **Human Errors in Testing**  
Manual processes invariably open room for inconsistency, oversight, and fatigue, leading to undetected bugs or vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Managing Extensive Test Suites**
Modern software requires managing thousands of test cases, pushing QA teams to prioritize their efforts while maintaining accuracy.

### 4. **Lack of Adequate Resources**  
Team bandwidth, budgets, and technical tools often fall short, preventing optimal testing.

### 5. **Constantly Shifting Requirements**  
Agile development methods complicate QA processes with frequently changing requirements.

AI-based solutions, such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), address these major obstacles by streamlining processes and enhancing productivity.
