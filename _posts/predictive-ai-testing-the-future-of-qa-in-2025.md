## What is Predictive AI Testing?

Predictive AI testing is the next frontier in QA, moving teams from reactive to proactive approaches. Traditional QA methods typically identified bugs post-development, after a user encountered an issue. This manual process or automated frameworks often failed to efficiently predict errors before deployment.

Predictive AI remedies this by employing algorithms driven by machine learning (ML), statistical analysis, and pattern recognition. These intelligent systems analyze historical data—including user interactions and prior tests—to anticipate potential vulnerabilities. Teams can now take preventive measures that reduce costs, enhance satisfaction, and boost overall software reliability.
