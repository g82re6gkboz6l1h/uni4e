## Understanding Predictive Analytics in Software Testing
Predictive analytics combines historical data, machine learning, and advanced algorithms to forecast potential future outcomes. In software testing, it identifies vulnerabilities, prioritizes critical areas, and mitigates risks before applications reach production.

### Key Insights from Predictive Analytics:
- **Prioritization:** AI identifies high-risk areas in the software requiring critical testing to optimize resources.
- **Optimization:** Predictive tools save time by detecting bottlenecks and reducing redundant tests.
- **Risk Assessment:** Advanced models provide insightful readiness scores before deployment.

By leveraging predictive analytics, QA teams enhance their efficiency and accuracy while reducing costs.
