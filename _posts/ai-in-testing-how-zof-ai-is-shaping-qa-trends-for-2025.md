## The Role of AI in Modern QA

Traditional QA relied heavily on manual testing, resulting in slow, error-prone processes and incomplete test coverage. AI has introduced revolutionary improvements by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing test coverage, and predicting defects with unparalleled precision. Key benefits of AI in QA include:

- Automated creation of test cases and regression testing.
- Accurate defect prediction and prevention.
- Improved test coverage and faster release cycles.
- Smarter testing adaptations based on user behavior.

Among the innovators, Zof AI has taken center stage with its advanced features that redefine software testing as we know it.
