## Machine Learning: The Backbone of AI QA Transformation

### **The Power of Machine Learning in QA**
Machine learning (ML), a core aspect of AI, has brought smart automation to QA. Moving beyond traditional scripted automation, ML enhances QA systems by identifying testing patterns and adapting automatically to system evolutions. Some standout AI capabilities in QA include:

1. **Dynamic Test Case Generation:**
   Automatically generate adaptive test cases that evolve based on behavioral insights from applications under test (AUT).

2. **Defect Prediction:**
   ML algorithms analyze historical data to isolate vulnerable code sections, forecasting potential bugs for timely testing.

3. **Self-Healing Automation:**
   Adaptation of scripts to accommodate UI updates or code changes, reducing disruption in QA workflows.

4. **Optimized Test Coverage:**
   AI determines and tests critical application areas, ensuring comprehensive coverage without redundant activities.

These abilities uplift QA processes, shifting its focus from traditional reactive methods to efficient, **proactive strategies**.
