## What is Predictive Testing?

Predictive testing represents the next generational leap in QA practices, moving beyond reactive approaches. By analyzing historical data, user patterns, source code, and system analytics, AI algorithms can proactively identify areas prone to risk. Predictive systems, like those in Zof AI, simulate behavior, detect anomalies, and create tailored testing pathways to ensure optimal coverage.

With predictive QA, teams can reduce uncertainty, mitigate hazards early, and prioritize testing efforts where they matter most. Real-time forecasting ensures applications are stress-tested against possible failures, empowering developers with robust data-driven recommendations.
