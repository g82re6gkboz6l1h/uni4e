## Evolution of QA Testing Strategies

Testing frameworks have transitioned from manual processes to AI-enhanced tools over the decades. Here’s a brief history:

1. **Manual Testing:**
   Early-stage QA required exhaustive manual execution of test cases and was prone to human errors.

2. **Automated Testing:**
   Tools like Selenium revolutionized repetitive tasks but lacked adaptability, leading to costly maintenance of static testing scripts.

3. **AI-Powered Testing:**
   AI platforms, such as **Zof AI**, have introduced adaptive automation. Features like predictive analysis, self-healing functionality, and intelligent test generation set these tools apart, making them essential in the increasingly complex world of software development.
