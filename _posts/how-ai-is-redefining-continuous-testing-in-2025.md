## Continuous Testing in Agile and DevOps: A Modern Backbone

Continuous testing is pivotal for today’s fast-paced software delivery cycles. By integrating testing into every phase of the software delivery lifecycle (SDLC), businesses can achieve quick feedback loops, reduce bugs, and minimize costs. Agile methodologies and DevOps practices rely on iterative and collaborative approaches, making automated and intelligent testing a necessity.

However, traditional test automation struggles with the increasing complexity of systems. AI solves this with scalable solutions that adapt to dynamic environments, ensuring that testing evolves alongside software development.
