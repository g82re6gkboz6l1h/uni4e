## How AI is Transforming Software Testing

AI has revolutionized software testing since its introduction into QA practices. Gone are the days when testing depended solely on manual efforts or rigid automation scripts. Today, AI empowers QA teams with tools capable of analyzing massive data sets, adapting to changes autonomously, and identifying risks faster than traditional methods.

From pattern recognition to predictive analytics, AI advances bring clarity and efficiency. Unlike earlier automation, which relied only on predefined human-written test cases, modern AI adapts independently, detecting subtle defects that manual testing often overlooks.
