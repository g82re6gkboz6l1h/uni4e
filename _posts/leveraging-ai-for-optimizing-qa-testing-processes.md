## Introduction to AI in QA Testing

Traditional manual QA methods are error-prone and time-intensive, while basic automation lacks adaptability for unforeseen complexities. AI addresses these gaps with machine learning (ML) algorithms, predictive analytics, and real-time adaptability. From autonomous test case generation to predicting failure zones, AI boosts precision and reduces manual intervention. Platforms like Zof AI offer machine learning-based automation to accelerate defect detection and optimize testing.
