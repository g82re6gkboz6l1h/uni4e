## What is Autonomous Testing?

Autonomous testing leverages AI to create self-governing testing systems capable of:
- Designing test cases autonomously
- Identifying and correcting bugs
- Adapting to changes in code
- Optimizing through machine learning for better accuracy

This transformative approach ensures cost-effective, efficient QA while preventing financial, legal, and reputational damage caused by errors in software releases.

## Benefits of AI in Self-Healing and Error Resolution

Self-healing tests eliminate common issues faced in traditional testing—like script failure due to application changes. AI algorithms predict and adapt to these changes autonomously.

### How AI Supports Self-Healing:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies structures and metadata patterns.
2. **Adaptive Fixes**: Automatically adjusts to code and UI updates.
3. **Continuous Learning**: Stores fixes to avoid errors in future regressions.

Platforms like **Zof AI** leverage these features to ensure faster debugging and optimize QA pipelines. By reducing manual intervention, companies achieve accelerated releases and reduced operational inefficiencies.
