## Introduction to AI in Software Testing

For years, software testing relied heavily on manual approaches and basic automation. While traditional automated methods improved productivity, they failed to address evolving challenges in modern software systems. By 2025, AI tools have not only filled this gap but also redefined expectations for quality assurance.

AI resolves key testing challenges across several domains:

1. **Efficiency**: AI eliminates repetitive testing tasks through intelligent automation.
2. **Accuracy**: Machine learning (ML) detects subtle bugs that other tools might miss.
3. **Scalability**: AI matches the pace of agile environments and increasing software complexity.
4. **Adaptability**: AI evolves alongside new software features, delivering smarter insights with historical data.
