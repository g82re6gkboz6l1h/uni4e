## Redefining Non-Functional Testing in the Age of AI

Non-functional testing is crucial in software development, assessing performance, reliability, scalability, and security. While functional testing checks if an app behaves as expected, non-functional testing ensures it can handle real-world demands, like supporting 10,000 concurrent users or staying secure from hackers.

Traditionally, this has been a manual, resource-heavy process, often struggling to keep pace with modern systems' complexity. Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI)—a game-changer set to redefine non-functional testing by automating tasks and offering deep, data-driven insights. By 2025, AI is forecasted to dominate the testing framework, with innovative companies like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) at the forefront of this transformation. Let's dive deeper into AI's impact on non-functional QA.
